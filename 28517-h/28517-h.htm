<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>HEPSEY BURKE</h3>
</div>
<p>The noisy, loose-jointed train pulled out of the
station, leaving behind it a solitary young
man, enveloped in smoke and cinders. In the
middle of the platform stood a little building with a
curb roof, pointed at both ends like a Noah&#8217;s Ark;
and the visitor felt that if he could only manage to
lift up one side of the roof he would find the animals
&#8220;two by two,&#8221; together with the cylindrical Noah
and the rest of his family. There was no one in
sight but the station-master, who called out from the
ticket office:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want to go to the village? The &#8217;bus
won&#8217;t be down till the next train: but maybe you can
ride up on the ice wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; the stranger replied. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll wait
for the &#8217;bus, if it&#8217;s not too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes or so, if Sam don&#8217;t have to collect
the passengers goin&#8217; West, and wait for a lot o&#8217;
women that forget their handbags and have to get
out and go back after &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new arrival was good to look at&mdash;a handsome,
well-built fellow of about twenty-five, dressed in a
gray suit which was non-committal as to his profession,
with a clean-shaven face which bore the unmistakable
stamp of good breeding and unlimited good-nature.
He tilted his suit-case on end and sat down
on it; then he filled his briar pipe, crossed his legs,
and looked about to take stock of the situation. He
gazed about curiously; but there was nothing of any
special interest in sight, except, painfully conspicuous
on the face of a grass terrace, the name of the
village picked out in large letters composed of oyster-shells
and the bottoms of protruding beer bottles
stuck in the ground. The stranger found himself
wondering where a sufficient number of bottles could
be found to complete such an elaborate pattern. The
only other marked feature of the landscape in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
way of artistic decoration was the corrugated base of
an old stove, painted white, which served as a flower
vase. From this grew a huge bunch of scarlet geraniums,
staring defiantly, and seeming fairly to sizzle in
the hot, vibrant atmosphere, which was as still as the
calm of a moon-lit night.</p>
<p>As the man on the suit-case gazed about him at the
general air of dilapidation and neglect characteristic
of a country town on the down grade, and recalled
the congenial life of the city which he had left, with
all its busy competition, with all its absorbing activities,
the companionship of the men he loved, and the
restful, inspiring intimacy with a certain young
woman, he felt, for the moment, a pang of homesickness.
If the station were a sample of the village
itself, then life in such a place must be deadening to
every finer sensibility and ambition; it must throw a
man back on himself and make him morbid.</p>
<p>The momentary depression was relieved by the
station-master, who suddenly appeared at the door
of the Ark and called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Hepsey Burke. Maybe she&#8217;ll take
you up; that&#8217;ll be a dum sight more comfortable than
Lipkin&#8217;s &#8217;bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing to be seen but a cloud of dust,
advancing with the rapidity of a whirlwind along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
highway, from which there gradually emerged a team
and a &#8220;democrat,&#8221; containing a woman, a boy about
fourteen, and a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>As the turn-out drew up, the man took the reins
from Mrs. Burke, who jumped out of the wagon
with remarkable agility for one of her size and years,
and, nodding to the station-master, came on to the
platform.</p>
<p>Hepsey Burke was rather stout; and the lines from
her nose to the corners of her mouth, and the wisps
of gray hair which had blown about her face, indicated
that she had passed the meridian of life. At
first glance there was nothing striking about her appearance;
but there was a subtle expression about the
mouth, a twinkle about the large gray eyes behind
the glasses she wore, that indicated a sense of humor
which had probably been a God-send to her. She
was strong and well, and carried with her an air of
indomitable conviction that things worked themselves
out all right in the long run.</p>
<p>The boy was obviously her son, and in spite of his
overalls and frayed straw hat, he was a handsome
little chap. He looked at you shyly from under a
crop of curly hair, with half closed eyes, giving you
the impression that you were being &#8220;sized up&#8221; by a
very discriminating individual; and when he smiled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
as he did frequently, he revealed a set of very white
and perfect teeth. When he was silent, there was a
little lifting of the inner brow which gave him a
thoughtful look quite beyond his years; and you were
sadly mistaken if you imagined that you could form
a correct impression of Nicholas Burke at the first
interview.</p>
<p>The man wore a sandy beard, but no mustache, and
had a downcast, meekly submissive air, probably the
depressing effect of many years of severe domestic
discipline.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke was evidently surprised to find no one
there but the man on the suit-case; but as he rose and
lifted his hat, she hesitated a moment, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, but I was lookin&#8217; for a parson who
was to arrive on this train. You haven&#8217;t seen anything
that looked like a parson, have you? You can
generally spot &#8217;em every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no; I seem to be the only passenger who
got off the train; and though I&#8217;m a clergyman, you
don&#8217;t seem to find it easy to &#8216;spot&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke, with a characteristic gesture, pulled
her glasses forward with a jerk and settled them firmly
back again on the bridge of her nose. She surveyed
the speaker critically as she questioned:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t seem to show the usual symptoms&mdash;collar
buttoned behind, and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to disappoint you, Madam, but I never
travel in clerical uniform. Can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got more sense than most parsons,
if I may say so. Maybe you&#8217;re the one I&#8217;m lookin&#8217;
for: Mr. Donald Maxwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my name, and I am sure you must be Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221;&mdash;shaking his outstretched hand
heartily. &#8220;Now you come right along with me, Mr.
Maxwell, and get into the democrat and make yourself
comfortable.&#8221; They walked round to the front
of the station. &#8220;This, Mr. Maxwell, is Jonathan
Jackson, the Junior Warden; and this is my son
Nicholas, generally known as Nickey, except when I
am about to spank him. Say, Jonathan, you just h&#8217;ist
that trunk into the back of the wagon, and Nickey,
you take the parson&#8217;s suit-case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Junior Warden grinned good-naturedly as he
shook hands with the new arrival. But Hepsey continued
briskly: &#8220;Now, Jonathan, you get into the back
seat with Nickey, and Mr. Maxwell, you sit with me
on the front seat so that I can talk to you. Jonathan
means well, but his talk&#8217;s limited to crops and symptoms,
even if he is an old friend, my next door neighbor,
and the Junior Warden.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Jonathan obeyed orders; and, as he got into the
wagon, winked at Maxwell and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see we have to take a back seat when Hepsey
drives; and we have to hold on with both hands.
She&#8217;s a pacer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you let him frighten you, Mr. Maxwell,&#8221;
Hepsey replied. &#8220;Jonathan would probably hold on
with both hands if he lay flat on his back in a ten-acre
lot. He&#8217;s just that fearless and enterprisin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, starting the horses with a cluck, she turned
to Maxwell and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I didn&#8217;t tell you I was glad to see you;
but I am. I got your note tellin&#8217; me when you were
comin&#8217;, but I didn&#8217;t get down to the station in time,
as the men are killin&#8217; hogs to-day, and until I get the
in&#8217;ards off my hands, I haven&#8217;t time for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have put you to the trouble of coming
at all. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very good of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble; not the least. I generally look after
the visitin&#8217; parsons, and I&#8217;m quite used to it. You
can get used to &#8217;most anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell laughed as he responded:</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak as if it weren&#8217;t always a pleasure, Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must admit that there are parsons and parsons.
They are pretty much of a lottery, and it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
generally my luck to draw blanks. But don&#8217;t you
worry about that; you don&#8217;t look a bit like a parson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a rather doubtful compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you know what I mean. There are
three kinds of people in the world; men, women, and
parsons; and I like a parson who is a man first, and
a parson afterwards; not one who is a parson first,
and a man two weeks Tuesday come Michaelmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald laughed: he felt sure he was going to make
friends with this shrewd yet open-hearted member of
his flock. The pace slackened as the road began a
steep ascent. Mrs. Burke let the horses walk up the
hill, the slackened reins held in one hand; in the other
lolled the whip, which now and then she raised, tightening
her grasp upon it as if for use, on second
thoughts dropping it to idleness again and clucking
to the horses instead. It was typical of her character&mdash;the
means of chastisement held handy, but in
reserve, and usually displaced by other methods of
suasion.</p>
<p>As they turned down over the brow of the hill they
drove rapidly, and as the splendid landscape of rolling
country, tilled fields and pasture, stretching on to
distant wooded mountains, spread out before him,
Maxwell exclaimed enthusiastically, drawing a deep
breath of the exhilarating air:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How beautiful it is up here! You must have a
delightful climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know as we have
much climate to speak of. We have just a job lot of
weather, and we take it regular&mdash;once after each
meal, once before goin&#8217; to bed, and repeat if necessary
before mornin&#8217;. I won&#8217;t say but it&#8217;s pretty good
medicine, at that. There&#8217;d be no show for the doctor,
if it wasn&#8217;t fashionable to invite him in at the
beginnin&#8217; and the end of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan, who up to this time had been silent, felt
it incumbent to break into the conversation a bit, and
interposed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve never been up in these parts before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Maxwell responded; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve always intended
to come up during the season for a little
hunting some time. Was there much sport last
year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say as there was, and I can&#8217;t say <i>as</i>
there wasn&#8217;t. The most I recollect was that two city
fellers shot a guide and another feller. But then it
was a poor season last fall, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell gave the Junior Warden a quick look,
but there was not a trace of a smile on his face, and
Hepsey chuckled. Keeping her eyes on the horses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
as they trotted along at a smart pace over a road none
too smooth for comfortable riding, she remarked
casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the Bishop told you what we wanted
in the shape of a parson, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he hinted a few things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;re awful modest, like most country parishes
that don&#8217;t pay their rector more than enough
to get his collars laundered. We want a man who
can preach like the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
call on everybody twice a week, and know just when
anyone is sick without bein&#8217; told a word about it.
He&#8217;s got to be an awful good mixer, to draw the
young people like a porous plaster, and fill the pews.
He must have lots of sociables, and fairs, and things
to take the place of religion; and he must dress well,
and live like a gentleman on the salary of a book-agent.
But if he brings city ways along with him and
makes us feel like hayseeds, he won&#8217;t be popular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a rather large contract!&#8221; Maxwell replied
with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but think what we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to pay you: six
hundred dollars a year, and you&#8217;ll have to raise most
of it yourself, just for the fun of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point the Junior Warden interrupted:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Hepsey, what&#8217;s the use of upsettin&#8217; the
young man at the start. He&#8217;s&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Jonathan. I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; the truth, anyway.
You see,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;most people think
piety&#8217;s at a low ebb unless we&#8217;re gettin&#8217; up some kind
of a holy show all the time, to bring people together
that wouldn&#8217;t meet anywhere else if they saw each
other first. Then when they&#8217;ve bought a chance on a
pieced bed-quilt, or paid for chicken-pie at a church
supper, they go home feelin&#8217; real religious, believin&#8217;
that if there&#8217;s any obligation between them and
heaven, it isn&#8217;t on their side, anyway. Do you think
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to fill the bill, Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Maxwell. &#8220;Of course
I might find myself possessed of a talent for inventing
new and original entertainments each week; but
I&#8217;m afraid that you&#8217;re a bit pessimistic, Mrs. Burke,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. There&#8217;s a mighty fine side to life
in a country parish sometimes, where the right sort
of a man is in charge. The people take him as one
of their family, you know, and borrow eggs of his
wife as easy as of their next door neighbor. But the
young reverends expect too much of a country parish,
and break their hearts sometimes because they can&#8217;t
make us tough old critters all over while you wait.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
Poor things! I&#8217;m sorry for the average country parson,
and a lot sorrier for his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you worry about me; I&#8217;m well and
strong, and equal to anything, I imagine. I don&#8217;t
believe in taking life too seriously; it&#8217;s bad for the
nerves and digestion. It will be an entirely new experience
for me, and I&#8217;m sure I shall find the people
interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but what if they aren&#8217;t your kind? I suppose
you might find hippopotamuses interestin&#8217; for a
while, but that&#8217;s no reason you should like to live with
&#8217;em. Anyway, don&#8217;t mind what people say. They
aint got nothin&#8217; to think about, so they make up by
talkin&#8217; about it, especially when it happens to be a
new parson. We&#8217;ve been havin&#8217; odds and ends of
parsons from the remnant counter now for six months
or more; and that&#8217;s enough to kill any parish. I
believe that if the angel Gabriel should preach for us,
half the congregation would object to the cut of his
wings, and the other half to the fit of his halo. We
call for all the virtues of heaven, and expect to get
&#8217;em for seven-forty-nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I shall have to look to you and the Wardens
to help me out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must help me
run things, until I know the ropes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Bascom will run things for you, if you let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
him do the runnin&#8217;,&#8221; she replied, cracking her whip.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll need to get popular first with him and his&mdash;then
you&#8217;ll have it easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell pondered these local words of wisdom,
and recalled the Bishop&#8217;s warning that Bascom, the
Senior Warden, had not made life easy for his predecessors,
and his superior&#8217;s exhortation to firmness and
tact, to the end that he, Maxwell, should hold his
own, while taking his Senior Warden along with him.
The Senior Warden was evidently a power in the land.</p>
<p>They had driven about a mile and a half when the
wagon turned off the road, and drew up by a house
standing some distance back from it; getting down,
Mrs. Burke exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to Thunder Cliff, Mr. Maxwell. Thunder
Cliff&#8217;s the name of the place, you know. All the
summer visitors in Durford have names for their
houses; so I thought I&#8217;d call my place Thunder Cliff,
just to be in the style.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan Jackson, who had kept a discreet silence
during Hepsey&#8217;s pointers concerning his colleague,
the Senior Warden, interjected:</p>
<p>&#8220;There &#8217;aint no cliff, Hepsey, and you know it. I
always tell her, Mr. Maxwell, &#8217;taint appropriate a
bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan, you &#8217;aint no Englishman, and there&#8217;s no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
use pretendin&#8217; that you are. Some day when I have
a couple of hours to myself, I&#8217;ll explain the whole
matter to you. There isn&#8217;t any cliff, and the house
wants paintin&#8217; and looks like thunder. Isn&#8217;t that reason
enough to go on with? Now, Mr. Maxwell, you
come in and make yourself perfectly at home.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>GOSSIP</h3>
</div>
<p>That afternoon Maxwell occupied himself in
unpacking his trunks and arranging his room.
As the finishing touch, he drew out of a leather
case an exquisite miniature of a beautiful girl,
which he placed on the mantelpiece, and at which he
gazed for a long time with a wistful light in his fine
gray eyes. Then he threw himself on the lounge, and
pulling a letter from his inner pocket, read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about expenses, dear. Six hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
is quite enough for two; we shall be passing rich!
You must remember that, although I am a &#8216;college
girl,&#8217; I am not a helpless, extravagant creature, and I
know how to economize. I am sure we shall be able
to make both ends meet. With a small house, rent
free, a bit of ground for a vegetable garden, and
plenty of fresh air, we can accomplish almost anything,
and be supremely happy together. And then,
when you win advancement, as of course you will very
soon, we shall appreciate the comforts all the more
from the fact that we were obliged to live the simple
life for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly imagine how I miss you, sweetheart.
Do write as soon as possible and tell me all
about Durford. If I could just have one glimpse of
you in your new quarters&mdash;but that would only be a
wretched aggravation; so I keep saying to myself
&#8216;Some day, some day,&#8217; and try to be patient. God
bless you and good-by.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Donald folded the letter carefully, kissed it, and
tucked it away in his pocket. Clasping his hands behind
his head, he gazed at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;d better tell Mrs. Burke about Betty.
I don&#8217;t care to pass myself off as a free man in a
parish like this. And yet, after all, it&#8217;s none of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
business at present. I think I&#8217;d better wait and find
out if there&#8217;s any possibility of making her happy
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk of angels,&#8221; murmured Maxwell, and hurriedly
returned the miniature to its case before opening
the door to Mrs. Burke, who came to offer assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother to fuss for me,&#8221; she said as he hastened
to remove some books and clothes from a chair,
so that she might sit down. &#8220;I only came up for a
moment to see if there was anything I could do.
Think you can make yourself pretty comfortable
here? I call this room &#8216;the prophet&#8217;s chamber,&#8217;
you know, because it&#8217;s where I always put the visitin&#8217;
parsons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lucky,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;This room is just
delightful with that jolly old fireplace, its big dormer
windows, and the view over the river and the hills
beyond: I shall be very comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope so. You know I don&#8217;t think any
livin&#8217;-room is complete without a fireplace. Next to
an old friend, a bright wood fire&#8217;s the best thing I
know to keep one from getting lonesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that and a good cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t smoked in some time now,&#8221; Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Burke replied, smiling, &#8220;so I can&#8217;t say. What a lot
of things you&#8217;ve got!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, more than I thought I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do love to see a man tryin&#8217; to put things to
rights. He never knows where anything belongs.
What an awful lot of books you&#8217;ve got! I suppose
you&#8217;re just chuck full of learnin&#8217;, clean up to your
back teeth; but we won&#8217;t any of us know the difference.
Most city parsons preach about things that are
ten miles over the heads of us country people. You
can&#8217;t imagine how little thinkin&#8217; most of us do up
here. We&#8217;re more troubled with potato bugs than we
are with doubts; and you&#8217;ll have to learn a lot about
us before you really get down to business, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I expect to learn more from you than you
will from me. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why I
wanted to come so far out in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! I hope you won&#8217;t be disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke adjusted her glasses and gazed interestedly
about the room at some pictures and decorations
which Maxwell had placed in position, and inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the plaster lady and gentleman standin&#8217;
on the mantelpiece?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Venus de Milo, and the Hermes of Praxiteles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, I just can&#8217;t help preferrin&#8217; ladies
and gentlemen with arms and legs, myself. I suppose
it&#8217;s real cultivated to learn to like parts of people
done in marble. Maybe when I go down to the city
next fall to buy my trousseau, I&#8217;ll buy a few plasters
myself, to make the house look more cheerful-like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell caught at the word &#8220;trousseau,&#8221; and as
Mrs. Burke had spoken quite seriously he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to be married, Mrs. Burke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No such thing! But when a handsome young
widow like me lives alone, frisky and sixty-ish, with
six lonesome, awkward widowers in the same school
district, you can never tell what might happen any
minute; &#8216;In time of peace prepare for war,&#8217; as the
paper says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell laughed reassuringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you laugh,&#8221; Mrs. Burke responded,
chuckling to herself. &#8220;&#8217;Taint polite to look surprised
when a woman says she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to get married.
Every woman under ninety-eight has expectations.
While there&#8217;s life there&#8217;s hope that some man
will make a fool of himself. But unless I miss my
guess, you don&#8217;t catch me surrenderin&#8217; my independence.
As long as I have enough to eat and am well,
I&#8217;m contented.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly look the picture of health, Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! as well as could be expected, when I&#8217;m
just recoverin&#8217; from a visit from Mary Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a visitor is that?&#8221; asked Maxwell,
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Sam is my sister-in-law. She spends a
month with me every year on her own invitation. She
is what you&#8217;d call a hardy annual. She is the most
stingy and narrow-minded woman I ever saw. The
bark on the trees hangs in double box-plaits as compared
with Mary Sam. But I got the best of her last
year. While I was cleanin&#8217; the attic I came across
the red pasteboard sign with &#8216;Scarlet Fever&#8217; painted
on it, that the Board of Health put on the house when
Nickey had the fever three years ago. The very next
day I was watchin&#8217; the &#8217;bus comin&#8217; up Main Street,
when I saw Mary Sam&#8217;s solferino bonnet bobbin&#8217; up
and down inside. Before she got to the house, I
sneaked out and pinned up the sign, right by the front
door. She got onto the piazza, bag, baggage, and
brown paper bundles, before she caught sight of it.
Then I wish you could have seen her face: I wouldn&#8217;t
have believed so much could be done with so few
features.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t linger long?&#8221; laughed the parson,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
who continued arranging his books while his visitor
chatted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Linger? Well, not exactly. She turned tail and
run lickety-spindle back for the &#8217;bus as if she had
caught sight of a subscription paper for foreign missions.
I heard Jim Anderson, who drives the &#8217;bus,
snicker as he helped her in again; but he didn&#8217;t give
me away. Jim and I are good friends. But when
she got home she wrote to Sally Ramsdale to ask how
Nickey was; and Sally, not bein&#8217; on to the game, wrote
back that there was nothin&#8217; the matter with Nickey
that she knew of. Then Mary Sam wrote me the
impudentest letter I ever got; and she came right
back, and stayed two months instead of one, just to
be mean. But that sign&#8217;s done good service since.
I&#8217;ve scared off agents and tramps by the score. I
always hang it in the parlor window when I&#8217;m away
from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose your house caught fire while you were
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve thought of that; but there&#8217;s worse
things than fire if your insurance is all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke relapsed into silence for a while, until
Maxwell opened a box of embroidered stoles, which
he spread out on the bed for her inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! but aren&#8217;t those beautiful! I never saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
like before. Where did you get &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were made by the &#8216;Sisters of St. Paul&#8217; in
Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey gazed at the stoles a long time in silence,
handling them daintily; then she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to embroider some myself. Would you
like to see some of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, I should be delighted to see it,&#8221; Donald
responded; and Mrs. Burke went in search of
her work.</p>
<p>Presently she returned and showed Maxwell a sample
of her skill&mdash;doubtless intended for a cushion-cover.
To be sure it was a bit angular and impressionistic.
Like Browning&#8217;s poems and Turner&#8217;s pictures,
it left interesting room for speculation. To
begin with, there was a dear little pink dog in the
foreground, having convulsions on purple grass. In
the middle-distance was a lay-figure in orange, picking
scarlet apples from what appeared to be a revolving
clothes-horse blossoming profusely at the ends
of each beam. A little blue brook gurgled merrily
up the hill, and disappeared down the other side only
to reappear again as a blue streak in an otherwise
crushed-strawberry sky. A pumpkin sun was disappearing
behind emerald hills, shooting up equidistant
yellow rays, like the spokes of a cart-wheel. Underneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
this striking composition was embroidered the
dubious sentiment &#8220;There is no place like home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell examined carefully the square of cross-stitch
wool embroidery, biting his lip; while Hepsey
watched him narrowly, chuckling quietly to herself.
Then she laughed heartily, and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Confess now; don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald smiled broadly as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really quite wonderful. Did you do it yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I did, when I was a little girl and we
used to work in wool from samplers, and learn to do
alphabets. I&#8217;m glad you appreciate it. If you would
like to have me embroider anything for the church,
don&#8217;t hesitate to ask me.&#8221; She busied herself examining
the stoles again, and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How much did these things cost, if you don&#8217;t
mind my askin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They were given to me by a friend
of mine, when I graduated from the Seminary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! a friend of yours, eh? She must think an
awful lot of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey gave Donald a sharp glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it was a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but your eyes and cheeks did. Well, it&#8217;s none
of my business, and there&#8217;s no reason that I know of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
why the Devil should have all the bright colors, and
embroideries, and things. Are you High Church?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell hesitated a moment and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;High Church?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last rector we had was awful high.&#8221; Hepsey
smiled with reminiscent amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspected he didn&#8217;t wear no pants durin&#8217; service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How very extraordinary! Is that a symptom of
ritualism?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see he wore a cassock under his surplice,
and none of our parsons had ever done that
before. The Senior Warden got real stirred up about
it, and told Mr. Whittimore that our rectors always
wore pants durin&#8217; service. Mr. Whittimore pulled
up his cassock and showed the Warden that he had
his pants on. The Warden told him it was an awful
relief to his mind, as he considered goin&#8217; without
pants durin&#8217; service the enterin&#8217; wedge for Popish
tricks; and if things went on like that, nobody knew
where we would land. Then some of the women got
talkin&#8217;, and said that the rector practiced celibacy, and
that some one should warn him that the parish
wouldn&#8217;t stand for any more innovations, and he&#8217;d
better look out. So one day, Virginia Bascom, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Senior Warden&#8217;s daughter, told him what was being
said about him. The parson just laughed at Ginty,
and said that celibacy was his misfortune, not his
fault; and that he hoped to overcome it in time. That
puzzled her some, and she came to me and asked
what celibacy was. When I told her it was staying
unmarried, like St. Paul&mdash;my, but wasn&#8217;t she mad,
though! You ought to have seen her face. She was
so mortified that she wouldn&#8217;t speak to me for a week.
Well, I guess I&#8217;ve gossiped enough for now. I must
go and make my biscuits for supper. If I can help
you any, just call out.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE SENIOR WARDEN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine morning, Mr. Maxwell,&#8221; Mrs. Burke
remarked at breakfast next day, &#8220;and I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to drive down to the village to do some shopping.
Don&#8217;t you want to go with me and pay your
respects to the Senior Warden? You&#8217;ll find him in
his office. Then I&#8217;ll meet you later, and bring you
home&mdash;dead or alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell laughed. &#8220;That sounds cheerful, but I
should be glad to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you better, and have it over with. He&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
expect it. He&#8217;s like royalty: he never calls first; and
when he&#8217;s at home he always has a flag on a pole in
the front yard. If he&#8217;s out of town for the day, his
man lowers the flag. I generally call when the flag&#8217;s
down. I wish everybody had a flag; it&#8217;s mighty convenient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center of Durford&#8217;s social, commercial and
ecclesiastical life was the village green, a plot of
ground on which the boys played ball, and in the middle
of which was the liberty pole and the band-stand.
On one side of the green was a long block of stores,
and on the opposite side a row of churches, side by
side, five in number. There was the Meeting House,
in plain gray; &#8220;The First Church of Durford,&#8221; with
a Greek portico in front; &#8220;The Central Church,&#8221;
with a box-like tower and a slender steeple with a gilded
rooster perched on top&mdash;an edifice which looked
like a cross between a skating rink and a railroad
station; and last of all, the Episcopal Church on the
corner&mdash;a small, elongated structure, which might
have been a carpenter-shop but for the little cross
which surmounted the front gable, and the pointed
tops of the narrow windows, which were supposed
to be &#8220;gothic&#8221; and to proclaim the structure to be the
House of God.</p>
<p>Just around the corner was a little tumble-down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
house known as &#8220;The Rectory.&#8221; The tall grass and
the lowered shades indicated that it had been unoccupied
for some time. Mrs. Burke called Maxwell&#8217;s
attention to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll be living there some day&mdash;if you
stay here long enough; though of course you can&#8217;t
keep house there alone. The place needs a lot of over-haulin&#8217;.
Nickey says there&#8217;s six feet of plaster off
the parlor ceilin&#8217;, and the cellar gets full of water
when it rains; but I guess we can fix it up when the
time comes. That&#8217;s your cathedral, on the corner.
You see, we have five churches, when we really need
only one; and so we have to scrap for each other&#8217;s
converts, to keep up the interest. We feed &#8217;em on
sandwiches, pickles and coffee every now and then, to
make &#8217;em come to church. Yes, preachin&#8217; and pickles,
sandwiches and salvation, seem to run in the same
class, these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they arrived in front of the block, Mrs.
Burke hitched her horse, and left Maxwell to his own
devices. He proceeded to hunt up the post office;
and as the mail was not yet distributed, he had to wait
some time, conscious of the fact that he was the center
of interest to the crowd assembled in the room.
Finally, when he gained access to the delivery window,
he was greeted by a smile from the postmistress,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
a woman of uncertain age, who remarked as she
handed him his letters:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Maxwell. Glad to meet you.
I&#8217;m a Presbyterian myself; but I have always made it
a point to be nice to everybody. You seem to have
quite a good many correspondents, and I presume
you&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217; a lock box. It&#8217;s so convenient. You
must feel lonesome in a strange place. Drop in and
see mother some day. She&#8217;s got curvature of the
spine, but no religious prejudices. She&#8217;ll be right glad
to see you, I&#8217;m sure, even though she&#8217;s not &#8217;Piscopal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell thanked her, and inquired the way to the
Senior Warden&#8217;s office, to which she directed him.</p>
<p>Three doors below the post office was a hallway
and a flight of stairs leading up to Mr. Bascom&#8217;s
sanctum. As he ascended, Maxwell bethought him
of the Bishop&#8217;s hint that this was the main stronghold
for the exercise of his strategy. The Senior
Warden, for some reason or other, had persistently
quarreled with the clergy, or crossed them. What was
the secret of his antagonism? Would he be predisposed
in Maxwell&#8217;s favor, or prejudiced against him?
He would soon discover&mdash;and he decided to let
Bascom do most of the talking. Reaching the first
landing, Donald knocked on a door the upper panel
of which was filled with glass, painted white. On
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the glass in large black letters was the name: &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Sylvester
Bascom</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senior Warden sat behind a table, covered
with musty books and a litter of letters and papers.
In his prime he had been a small man; and now, well
past middle age, he looked as if he had shrunk until
he was at least five sizes too small for his skin, which
was sallow and loose. There was a suspicious look
in his deep-set eyes, which made his hooked nose all
the more aggressive. He was bald, except for a few
stray locks of gray hair which were brushed up from
his ears over the top of his head, and evidently fastened
down by some gluey cosmetic. He frowned
severely as Maxwell entered, but extended a shriveled,
bony hand, and pointed to a chair. Then
placing the tips of his fingers together in front of
his chest, he gazed at Donald as if he were the prisoner
at the bar, and began without any preliminary
welcome:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are the young man who is to take charge
of the church. It is always difficult for a city-bred
man to adjust himself to the needs and manners of a
country parish. Very difficult, Mr. Maxwell&mdash;very
difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell smiled as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that is a fault which time will remedy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless. Time has a way of remedying most
things. But in the meantime&mdash;in the meantime, lack
of tact, self-assertiveness, indiscretion, on the part of
a clergyman may do much harm&mdash;much harm!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell colored slightly as he laughed and
replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I should imagine that you have had rather a &#8216;mean
time,&#8217; from the way you speak. Your impressions of
the clergy seem to be painful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the lawyer continued sententiously, &#8220;we
have had all sorts and conditions of men, as the
Prayer Book says; and the result has not <i>always</i> been
satisfactory&mdash;<i>not</i> always satisfactory. But I was not
consulted.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this, Maxwell, who was somewhat nettled, replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that in any case the responsibility for the
success of a parish must be somewhat divided between
the parson and the people. I am sure I may count on
your assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes; oh yes; of course. I shall be very glad
to advise you in any way I can. Prevention is better
than cure: don&#8217;t hesitate to come to me for suggestions.
You will doubtless be anxious to follow in the
good old ways, and avoid extremes. I am a firm believer
in expediency. Though I was not consulted in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the present appointment, I may say that what we need
is a man of moderate views who can adjust himself
to circumstances. Tact, that is the great thing in life.
I am a firm believer in tact. Our resources are limited;
and a clergyman should be a self-denying man
of God, contented with plain living and high thinking.
No man can succeed in a country parish who
seeks the loaves and fishes of the worldling. Durford
is not a metropolis; we do not emulate city
ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I should imagine not,&#8221; Maxwell answered.</p>
<p>The parson gathered that the Senior Warden felt
slighted that he had not been asked by the Bishop to
name his appointee; and that if he had bethought
himself to sprinkle a little hay-seed on his clothing,
his reception might have been more cordial.</p>
<p>At this point the door opened and a woman, hovering
somewhere between twenty-five and forty,
dressed in rather youthful and pronounced attire, entered,
and seeing Donald exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, I did not know that you were busy with
a client. Do excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, observing the clerical attire of the &#8220;client,&#8221;
she came forward, and extending her hand to Donald,
exclaimed with a coy, insinuating smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that you must be Mr. Maxwell. I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
so glad to see you. I hope I am not interrupting
professional confidences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; Donald replied, as he placed
a chair for her. &#8220;I am very glad to have the pleasure
of meeting you, Miss Bascom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard last night that you had arrived, Mr. Maxwell;
and I am sure that it is very good of you to
come and see papa so soon. I hope to see you at our
house before long. You know that we are in the
habit of seeing a good deal of the rector, because&mdash;you
will excuse my frankness&mdash;because there are so
few people of culture and refinement in this town to
make it pleasant for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that you are very kind,&#8221; Donald replied.
Miss Bascom had adjusted her tortoise-shell lorgnette,
and was surveying Donald from head to
foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your wife with you?&#8221; she inquired, as one who
would say: &#8220;Tell me no lies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not married.&#8221;</p>
<p>At once she was one radiant smile of welcome:</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa, we must do all we can to make Mr. Maxwell
feel at home at Willow Bluff&mdash;so that he will
not get lonesome and desert us,&#8221; she added genially.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must come and dine with us very soon and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
see our place for yourself. You are staying with Mrs.
Burke, I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does she impress you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know her well enough to form any definite
opinion of her, though she has been kindness
itself to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she has a sharp tongue, but a kind heart;
and she does a great deal of good in the village; but,
poor soul! she has no sense of humor&mdash;none whatever.
Then of course she is not in society, you know.
You will find, Mr. Maxwell, that social lines are very
carefully drawn in this town; there are so many
grades, and one has to be careful, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so! How many people are there in the
town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly eight or nine hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how many of them are &#8216;in society&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I should imagine not more than twenty or
thirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be very select.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are; quite so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever get tired of seeing the same twenty
or thirty all the time? I&#8217;m afraid I am sufficiently
vulgar to like a change, once in a while&mdash;somebody
real common, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Miss Bascom raised her lorgnette in pained surprise
and gazed at Donald curiously; then she sighed
and tapping her fingers with her glasses replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;But one has to consider the social responsibilities
of one&#8217;s position, you know. Many of the village
people are well enough in their way, really quite
amusing as individuals; but one cannot alter social
distinctions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Donald, non-committally.</p>
<p>Virginia was beginning to think that the new rector
was rather dull in his perceptions, rather <i>gauche</i>,
but, deciding to take a charitable view, she held out
her hand with a beaming smile as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, you are to make Willow Bluff one of
your homes. We shall always be charmed to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, after their respective shoppings were completed,
Maxwell rejoined Mrs. Burke, and they had
started on a brisk trot towards home, she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have had a visit with the Senior Warden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and with Miss Bascom. She came into the
office while I was there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Well! She&#8217;s one of your flock!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you call Miss Bascom one of my lambs?&#8221;
asked Donald mischievously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that depends on where you draw the line.
Don&#8217;t you think she&#8217;s handsome?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly say. What do you think about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. When she&#8217;s well dressed she
has a sort of style about her; but isn&#8217;t it merciful
that we none of us know how we really do look? If
we did, we wouldn&#8217;t risk bein&#8217; alone with ourselves
five minutes without a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that one for Miss Bascom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ought not to say a word against Virginia
Bascom. She&#8217;s a good sort accordin&#8217; to her lights;
and then too, she is a disconnection of mine by marriage&mdash;once
removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you calculate that relationship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, her mother&#8217;s brother married my sister. She
suspected that he was guilty of incompatibility&mdash;and
she proved it, and got a divorce. If that don&#8217;t make
a disconnection of Ginty Bascom, then I don&#8217;t know
what does. Virginia was born in Boston, though she
was brought up here. It must be terrible to be born
in Boston, and have to live up to it, when you spend
your whole life in a place like Durford. But Ginty
does her very best, though occasionally she forgets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hardly blame her for that. Memory is
tricky, and Boston and Durford are about as unlike
as two places well could be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I don&#8217;t blame her. Once she formed a
club for woman&#8217;s suffrage. She set out to &#8216;form my
mind&#8217;&mdash;as if my mind wasn&#8217;t pretty thoroughly
formed at this time of day&mdash;and get me to protest
against the tyranny of the male sex. I didn&#8217;t see that
the male sex was troublin&#8217; her much; but I signed a
petition she got up to send to the Governor or somebody,
asking for the right to vote. There was an
opposition society that didn&#8217;t want the ballot, and
they got up another petition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you signed that too, I expect,&#8221; laughed Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing, I did. I&#8217;m not narrow-minded, and
I like to be obliging. Then she tried what she called
slummin&#8217;, which, as near as I can see, means walkin&#8217;
in where you &#8217;aint wanted, because people are poorer
than you are, and leavin&#8217; little tracts that nobody
reads, and currant jelly that nobody eats, and clothes
that nobody can wear. But an Irishman shied a cabbage
at her head while she was tryin&#8217; to convince him
that the bath-tub wasn&#8217;t really a coal bin, and that
his mental attitude was hindside before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she got to be a Theosophist, and used to
sit in her room upstairs projecting her astral body
out of the window into the back yard, and pulling it
in again like a ball on a rubber string&mdash;just for practice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
you know. But that attack didn&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to be a very versatile young woman;
but she doesn&#8217;t stick to one thing very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A rolling stone gathers no moss, you know,&#8221; Mrs.
Burke replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the advantages of
bein&#8217; a rolling stone. It must be awful to get mossy;
and there isn&#8217;t any moss on Virginia Bascom, whatever
faults she may have&mdash;not a moss.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Burke was silent, and then
she began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Once Virginia got to climbin&#8217; her family tree, to
find out where her ancestors came from. She thought
that possibly they might be noblemen. But I guess
there wasn&#8217;t very much doin&#8217; up the tree until she got
down to New York, and paid a man to tell her. She
brought back an illuminated coat of arms with a lion
rampantin&#8217; on top; but she was the same old Virginia
still. What do I care about my ancestors! It doesn&#8217;t
make no difference to me. I&#8217;m just myself anyway,
no matter how you figure; and I&#8217;m a lot more worried
about where I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to, than where I came
from. Virginia&#8217;s got a book called &#8216;Who&#8217;s Who,&#8217;
that she&#8217;s always studying. But the only thing that
matters, it seems to me, is Who&#8217;s What.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder she hasn&#8217;t married,&#8221; remarked Donald,
innocently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the trouble. She&#8217;s like a thousand
others without no special occupation in life. She&#8217;s
wastin&#8217; a lot of bottled up interest and sympathy on
foolish things. If she&#8217;d married and had seven babies,
they would have seen to it that she didn&#8217;t make a
fool of herself. However, it isn&#8217;t her fault. She&#8217;s
volunteered to act as Deaconess to every unmarried
parson we&#8217;ve had; and it&#8217;s a miracle of wonders one
of &#8217;em didn&#8217;t succumb; parsons are such&mdash;oh, do excuse
me! I mean so injudicious on the subject of
matrimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mrs. Burke, don&#8217;t you think a clergyman
ought to be a married man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell you the truth, t&#8217;aint me that&#8217;s been
doin&#8217; the thinkin&#8217; along those lines, for most of the
parsons we&#8217;ve had. I&#8217;ve been more of a first aid to
the injured, in the matrimonial troubles of our parish,
and the Lord only knows when love-making has
got as far as actual injury to the parties engaged,&mdash;well
thinkin&#8217; &#8217;aint much use. But there&#8217;s Ginty for
example. She&#8217;s been worryin&#8217; herself thin for the
last five years, doin&#8217; matrimonial equations for the
clergy. She&#8217;s a firm believer in the virtue of patience,
and if the Lord only keeps on sendin&#8217; us
unmarried rectors, Ginty is goin&#8217; to have her day.
It&#8217;s just naturally bound to come. I &#8217;aint sure whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
she&#8217;s got a right to be still runnin&#8217; with the lambs or
not, but that don&#8217;t matter much,&mdash;old maids will
rush in where angels fear to tread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell smiled. &#8220;Old maids, and old bachelors,
are pretty much alike. I know a few of the latter,
that no woman on earth could make into regular
human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; old bachelors aren&#8217;t the nicest thing the
Lord ever made. Most of &#8217;em are mighty selfish
critters, take &#8217;em as they run; and a man that&#8217;s never
had a real great love in his life doesn&#8217;t know what
life is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite true,&#8221; Donald responded, with such
warmth that Mrs. Burke glanced at him suspiciously,
and changed her tune, as she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me a parson, or any other man, is very
foolish to marry before he can support a wife comfortably,
and lay by somethin&#8217; for a rainy day, though.
The last rector had five babies and seventeen cents
to feed &#8217;em with. Yes, there were little olive branches
on all four sides of the table, and under the table too.
The Whittimores seemed to have their quiver full of
&#8217;em, as the psalmist says. Mrs. Whittimore used to
say to me, &#8216;The Lord will provide,&#8217;&mdash;just to keep her
courage up, poor thing! Well, I suppose the Lord
did provide; but I had to do a lot of hustlin&#8217;, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the same. No sir, if a parson marries, he better find
a woman who has outgrown her short skirts. Young
things dyin&#8217; to be martyrs with a good lookin&#8217; young
parson, are a drug in the market. Better go slow.&#8221;
And Hepsey looked up at him significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think it would be inadvisable to propose
to Miss Virginia immediately, do you?&#8221; Donald
asked, as if humbly seeking guidance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any immediate
hurry about it. Now if you&#8217;ll open the gate to Thunder
Cliff, I&#8217;ll be much obliged to you. If I don&#8217;t get
my mind on something less romantic than Virginia,
we shall have to dine off airy fancies&mdash;and that won&#8217;t
suit Nickey, for one.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>MILKING</h3>
</div>
<p>Betty, my love:</p>
<p>I can imagine that just about this time you
have finished your dinner, and are enjoying
your after-dinner coffee in the library with your
father. I would give all that I possess, though
heaven knows that is mighty little, to be with you
and get you to talk to me, and let me tell you all that
has happened since I left you. But instead of that I
am alone in my room with your picture on the table
while I write, and it is the middle of the evening with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
us on the farm. I have a bright wood fire on the
hearth, as it&#8217;s a bit chilly to-night.</p>
<p>To-day I have almost completed my first round of
parish visits, and the experience has been a revelation
to me of the mixture of pathetic narrowness, hardship,
and self-denial of the people up here in the
mountains. One minute I am all out of patience with
their stupidity, and the next I am touched to the heart
by their patience with unendurable conditions, and
their generosity and kindness to each other. I hope
to be able to adjust my mental equilibrium to the situation
before long and to learn to understand them
better; I find that a country parson must be a man
of many accomplishments, and that I have to learn
my profession all over again. Yesterday I called on
a poor shriveled old woman who, I was told, was in
trouble. When I asked her what I could do for her,
she brightened up and informed me that her apple
trees were full of worms! So there was nothing for
it but to take off my coat and vest, roll up my sleeves,
and burn out the worms. I must have destroyed
about a bushel, more or less. It took most of the
afternoon; but she was pleased, and appeared in
church this morning for the first time in six years.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot about the rotation of crops,
helped to dig a well, and attended a barn dance. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
have eaten pickles by the score at teas given in my
honor, rather than offend the hostess; and have had
horrible nights in consequence. Every morning
Nickey and I take the milk down to the creamery before
breakfast. I am so tanned that you would hardly
recognize me; and I must confess with shame that I
am never more happy than when I am able to put on
my soiled working clothes and do manual labor on
the farm. I suppose it is the contrast to my former
life, and the fact that it takes my thoughts away from
the longing for you.</p>
<p>The men up here seem to think I know mighty little.
It&#8217;s very humiliating! But since they discovered
that I am neither &#8220;&#8217;ristocratic&#8221; nor &#8220;pious,&#8221; they
seem to be friendly enough. I often find myself wondering
if much of the work in the seminary wasn&#8217;t a
sheer waste of time, when I am brought up against
the practical, commonplace, everyday life of these
people. My friend Mrs. Burke has a fund of common
sense and worldly wisdom which is worth more
than any Ph.D. or S.T.D. represents, to help a man
to meet the hard facts of life successfully; and she
has been very nice and considerate in making suggestions
to me&mdash;always wrapped up in a humor all
her own. I have found it practically impossible to
get into touch with the farmers of the neighborhood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
without becoming more or less of a farmer myself,
and learning by actual experience what the life is like.
One man was so openly supercilious when he found
out that I did not know how to milk, that Mrs. Burke,
who is nothing if not practical, offered to show
me.</p>
<p>I have acquired a suit of overalls, and a wide-brimmed
straw hat; and so, attiring myself in the
most orthodox fashion, Mrs. Burke and I went to
the shed yesterday where Louise, the Jersey cow,
abides, and I took my first lesson in milking. Mrs.
Burke carefully explained to me the <i>modus operandi</i>
I was to pursue; and so, taking the tin pail between
my knees, I seated myself on the three-legged stool
by the side of Louise, and timidly began operations.
She seemed to know by some bovine instinct that I
was a tenderfoot; and although I followed Mrs.
Burke&#8217;s instructions to the letter, no milk put in its
appearance. Mrs. Burke was highly amused at my
perplexity. Finally she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to introduce yourself, and get Louise&#8217;s
confidence before she&#8217;ll give down. She thinks that
you are too familiar on a short acquaintance. Now
talk to her a bit, and be friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was somewhat of a poser, as Louise and I
really have not much in common, and I was at a loss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
where to begin. But something had to be done, and
so I made a venture and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise, the wind is in the south; and if it doesn&#8217;t
change, we shall certainly have rain within three
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>This did not seem to have the desired effect. In
fact, she ignored my remark in the most contemptuous
fashion. Then Mrs. Burke suggested:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, and come round where she can see you.
No lady wants to be talked to by a gentleman that&#8217;s
out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I got up and went around by her head, fed her
some clover, patted her on the neck, rubbed her nose,
and began a little mild, persuasive appeal:</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise, I am really a man of irreproachable character.
I am a son of the Revolution; I held three
scholarships in Harvard; and I graduated second in
my class at the General Sem. Furthermore, I&#8217;m not
at all accustomed to being snubbed by ladies. Can&#8217;t
you make up your mind to be obliging?&#8221;</p>
<p>Louise sniffed at me inquiringly, gazing at me with
large-eyed curiosity. Then as if in token that she
had come to a favorable conclusion, she ran out her
tongue and licked my hand. When I resumed operations,
the milk poured into the pail, and Mrs. Burke
was just congratulating me on my complete success,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
when, by some accident the stool slipped, and I fell
over backwards, and the whole contents of the pail
was poured on the ground. My! but wasn&#8217;t I disgusted?
I thought Mrs. Burke would never stop
laughing at me; but she was good enough not to allude
to the loss of the milk!</p>
<p>Some day when we are married, and you come up
here, I will take you out and introduce you to Louise,
and she will fall in love with you on the spot.</p>
<p>My most difficult task is my Senior Warden&mdash;and
it looks as if he <i>would not</i> make friends, do what I
will to &#8220;qualify&#8221; according to his own expressed notions
of what a country parson should be. But I
rather suspect that he likes to keep the scepter in his
own hands, while the clergy do his bidding. But that
won&#8217;t do for me.</p>
<p>So you see the life up here is interesting from its
very novelty, though I do get horribly lonesome,
sometimes. If I had not pledged myself to the
Bishop to stay and work the parish together into
something like an organization, I am afraid I should
be tempted to cut and run&mdash;back to you, sweetheart.</p>
<p>And there was a post script:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not said half enough of how much Mrs.
Burke&#8217;s wisdom has taught and helped me. She is
a shrewd observer of human motives, and I expect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
she has had a struggle to keep the sweetness of her
nature at the top. She is, naturally, a capable, dominating
character; and often I watch how she forces
herself to let persuasiveness take precedence of combativeness.
Her acquired philosophy, as applied to
herself and others, is summed up in a saying she let
drop the other day, modified to suit her needs: &#8216;More
flies are caught with molasses than with vinegar&mdash;but
keep some vinegar by you!&#8217; <i>Verb. Sap.!</i>&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_V_THE_MINIATURE' id='CHAPTER_V_THE_MINIATURE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE MINIATURE</h3>
</div>
<p>It happened that the Reverend Donald Maxwell
committed a careless indiscretion. When he
went to his room to prepare for supper, he found
that he had left the miniature of a certain young lady
on the mantelpiece, having forgotten to return it to
its hiding-place the night before. He quickly placed
it in its covering and locked it up in his desk, but not
without many misgivings at the thought that Mrs.
Burke had probably discovered it when she put his
room in order.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>He was quite right in his surmise, for just as she
was about to leave the room she had caught sight of
the picture, and, after examining it carefully, she had
exclaimed to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Hm! So that&#8217;s the young woman, is it?
In a gilded frame set with real glass rubies and turquoises.
I guessed those letters couldn&#8217;t come from
his mother. She wouldn&#8217;t write to him every blessed
day; she&#8217;d take a day off now and then, just to rest
up a bit. Well, well, well! So this is what you&#8217;ve
been dreaming about; and a mighty good thing too&mdash;only
the sooner it&#8217;s known the better. But I suppose
I&#8217;ll have to wait for his reverence to inform me officially,
and then I&#8217;ll have to look mighty surprised!
She&#8217;s got a good face, anyway; but he ought to wait
awhile. Poor soul! she&#8217;d just die of loneliness up
here. Well, I suppose it&#8217;ll be my business to look
after her, and I reckon I&#8217;d best take time by the fetlock,
and get the rectory in order. It isn&#8217;t fit for rats
to live in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke&#8217;s discovery haunted her all day long,
and absorbed her thoughts when she went to bed. If
Maxwell was really engaged to be married, she did
not see why he did not announce the fact, and have it
over with. She had to repeat her prayers three times
before she could keep the girl in the gilt frame out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
of them; and she solved the problem by praying that
she might not make a fool of herself.</p>
<p>The next morning she went over to Jonathan Jackson&#8217;s
house to see what her friend and neighbor, the
Junior Warden, would say about the matter. He
could be trusted to keep silent and assist her to carry
out some provisional plans. She knew exactly what
she wished and what she intended to do; but she imagined
that she wanted the pleasure of hearing some
one tell her that she was exactly right.</p>
<p>Jonathan Jackson was precisely the person to satisfy
the demand, as his deceased wife had never allowed
him to have any opinion for more than fifteen
minutes at a time&mdash;if it differed from hers; and when
she had made a pretense of consulting him, he had
learned by long experience to hesitate for a moment,
look judicially wise, and then repeat her suggestions
as nearly as he could remember them. So Jonathan
made a most excellent friend and neighbor, when
any crisis or emergency called for an expert opinion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke had been an intimate friend of Sarah
Jackson, and just before Mrs. Jackson died she made
Hepsey promise that after she was gone she would
keep a friendly eye on Jonathan, and see that he did
not get into mischief, or let the house run down, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
&#8220;live just by eatin&#8217; odds and ends off the pantry shelf
any old way.&#8221; Mrs. Jackson entertained no illusions
in regard to her husband, and she trusted Hepsey
implicitly. So, after Mrs. Jackson&#8217;s mortal departure,
Hepsey made periodic calls on Jonathan, which
always gave him much pleasure until she became inquisitive
about his methods of housekeeping; then
he would grow reticent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Jonathan,&#8221; Hepsey called, as she
presented herself at the woodshed door, where she
caught Jonathan mending some of his underclothes
laboriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I declare,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I&#8217;m blessed if
you &#8217;aint sewin&#8217; white buttons on with black thread.
Is anybody dead in the family, or &#8217;aint you feelin&#8217; well
as to your head this mornin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice quavered with mingled embarrassment
and resentment as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make, Hepsey? It don&#8217;t
make no difference, as long as nobody don&#8217;t see it but
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why in the name of conscience don&#8217;t you get
a thimble, Jonathan? The idea of your stickin&#8217; the
needle in, and then pressin&#8217; it against the chair to
make it go through. If that &#8217;aint just like a helpless
man, I wouldn&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 377px;'>
&#8220;I&#8217;M BLESSED IF YOU &#8217;AINT SEWIN&#8217; WHITE BUTTONS ON WITH BLACK THREAD. IS ANYBODY DEAD IN THE FAMILY, OR &#8217;AINT YOU FEELIN&#8217; WELL THIS MORNIN&#8217;?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course sewin&#8217; &#8217;aint just a man&#8217;s business,
anyway; and when he has just got to do it&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let Mary McGuire do it for you?
You pay her enough, certainly, to keep you from becomin&#8217;
a buttonless orphan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary McGuire, be it said, was the woman who
came in by the day, and cooked for Jonathan, and
intermittently cleaned him out of house and home.</p>
<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t know much about such things,&#8221; replied
Jonathan confidentially. &#8220;I did let her do it for a
while; but when my buttonholes got tore larger, instead
of sewin&#8217; &#8217;em up, she just put on a larger button;
and I&#8217;d be buttonin&#8217; my pants with the covers of
saucepans by now, if I&#8217;d let her go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is curious what helpless critters men are, specially
widowers. Now Jonathan, why don&#8217;t you lay
aside your sewin&#8217;, and invite me into your parlor?
You aren&#8217;t a bit polite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come along then, Hepsey; but the parlor
aint just in apple-pie order, as you might say. Things
are mussed up a bit.&#8221; He looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>When they entered the parlor Mrs. Burke gazed
about in a critical sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan Jackson, if you don&#8217;t get married again
before long I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;ll become of you,&#8221; she
remarked, as she wrote her name with the end of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
finger in the dust on the center-table. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you open the parlor occasionally and let the air in?
It smells that musty in here I feel as if I was attendin&#8217;
your wife&#8217;s funeral all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course you know we never did use the
parlor much, &#8217;cept there was a funeral in the family,
or you called, or things like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank <i>you</i>; but even so, you might put things
away occasionally, and not leave them scattered all
over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? I never can find anything when
it&#8217;s where it belongs; but if it&#8217;s left just where I drop
it, I know right where it is when I want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a man&#8217;s argument. Sakes alive! The
least you could do would be to shut your bureau drawers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use shuttin&#8217; bureau drawers when
you&#8217;ve got to open &#8217;em again &#8217;fore long?&#8221; Jonathan
asked. &#8220;It just makes so much more trouble; and
there&#8217;s trouble enough in this world, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t dare let things go like this when
Sarah was livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Jonathan replied sadly, &#8220;but there&#8217;s some
advantages in bein&#8217; a widower. Of course I don&#8217;t
mean no disrespect to Sarah, but opinions will differ
about some things. She&#8217;d never let me go up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
front stairs without takin&#8217; my boots off, so as not to
soil the carpet; and when she died and the relatives
tramped up and down reckless like, I almost felt as
if it was wicked. For a fact, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I always told Sarah she was a slave to dust;
I believe that dust worried her a lot more than her
conscience, poor soul. I should think that Mary McGuire
would tidy up for you a little bit once in a
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mary does the best she knows how. But I
like her goin&#8217; better than comin&#8217;. The fact is, a man
of my age can&#8217;t live alone always, Hepsey. It&#8217;s a
change to live this way, till&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, heaven save the mark! I can&#8217;t stay here talkin&#8217;
all day; but I&#8217;ll tidy up a bit before I go, if you
don&#8217;t mind, Jonathan. You go on with what you call
your sewin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Hepsey. You can do anything you
like,&#8221; he replied, beaming upon her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke opened the blinds and windows, shook
up the pillows on the lounge, straightened the furniture,
dusted off the chairs and opened the door to the
porch. She made a flying trip to the garden, and returned
with a big bunch of flowers which she placed
in a large glass vase on the mantel. Then she hung
Jonathan&#8217;s dressing gown over the back of a chair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
and put his slippers suggestively near at hand. In a
few moments she had transformed the whole appearance
of the room, giving it a look of homelike coziness
which had long been foreign to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, Jonathan! That&#8217;s better, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan sighed profoundly as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is, Hepsey; it certainly is. I wonder
why a man can&#8217;t do that kind of thing like a woman
can? He knows somethin&#8217;s wrong, but he can&#8217;t tell
what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey had almost forgotten her errand; but now
that her work was done it came back to her with sudden
force; so, puckering up her lips and scowling
severely at the carpet, she began:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, Jonathan, I didn&#8217;t come over here to
dust the parlor or to jolly you. I&#8217;ve come to have a
confidential talk with you about a matter of great importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Hepsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matrimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan started eagerly, and colored with self-conscious
embarrassment; and after clearing his
throat, nervously inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think of contemplatin&#8217; matrimony again,
Hepsey?&mdash;though this &#8217;aint leap year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, contemplate matrimony? Oh, land of Gideon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
<i>no</i>. It&#8217;s about some one else. Don&#8217;t get scared. I&#8217;m
no kidnapper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who is it, then?&#8221; Jonathan inquired, with a
touch of disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;My adopted son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! I&#8217;ve heard rumors about Maxwell
and Virginia Bascom; but I didn&#8217;t take no stock
in &#8217;em, knowin&#8217; Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia hasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who has then, for land&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the girl&#8217;s name; but I saw her picture
on his mantelpiece yesterday mornin&#8217;, and I&#8217;ve
had my suspicions for some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose his marryin&#8217; &#8217;aint none of our
business anyway, be it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is our business; if he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to get married,
the rectory&#8217;s got to be fixed over a whole lot
&#8217;fore it&#8217;s fit to live in. You know the Senior Warden
won&#8217;t lift his finger, and you&#8217;ve got to help me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan sighed profoundly, knowing from past
experience that Hepsey&#8217;s word carried more weight
than all the vestry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I have, if you say so, Hepsey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir, you&#8217;ve got to help me do it. No decent
girl is goin&#8217; into that house as it is, with my consent.
It&#8217;s the worst old rat-trap I ever saw. I&#8217;ve got the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
key, and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; through it this afternoon, and then
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to plan what ought to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it seems to me you&#8217;re venturin&#8217; some. You
don&#8217;t <i>know</i> they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but all the symptoms point that way, and
we&#8217;ve got to be prepared for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the people round town seem to think that
Virginia has a first mortgage on the rector already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt <i>she</i> thinks she has; but it &#8217;aint true.
He&#8217;s made a blunder, though, not announcin&#8217; his engagement,
and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell him so the first chance
I get. I don&#8217;t see why he should air his private affairs
all over the town, but if he don&#8217;t announce his engagement
before long, Virginia Bascom&#8217;ll make an
awful row when he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and to the best of my knowledge and belief
this&#8217;ll be her fifth row.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you meet me at the rectory at two o&#8217;clock
sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we ought to consult the vestry first,&#8221; the
Junior Warden cautioned her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause they are the trustees of the property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t they &#8217;tend to the property? The
vestry are a lot of&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sh! Hepsey, be careful. I&#8217;ll be there, I&#8217;ll be
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke rose and started for the door; but Jonathan
called out to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey, can&#8217;t you stay to dinner? I&#8217;d like awful
well to have you. It would seem so nice and homelike
to see you sittin&#8217; opposite me at the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to consider this a proposal of marriage,
Jonathan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hadn&#8217;t thought of it in that light; but if
<i>you</i> would, I&#8217;d be mighty thankful.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hepsey was beating her retreat.</p>
<p>Jonathan stood for a minute or two in the middle
of the room and looked very sober. Slowly he took
off his coat and put on his dressing gown. Then he
sat down, and cautiously put his feet in another chair.
Next he lighted a cigar&mdash;gazing about the room as if
his late wife might appear at any moment as an avenging
deity, and drag him into the kitchen where he belonged.
But nothing happened, and he began to feel
a realization of his independence. He sat and thought
for a long time, and a mighty hunger of the heart
overwhelmed him. Before he knew it, a tear or two
had fallen on the immaculate carpet; and then, suddenly
recollecting himself, he stood up, saying to himself&mdash;such
is the consistency of man:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah was a good soul accordin&#8217; to her lights; but
she&#8217;s dead, and I must confess I&#8217;m powerful reconciled.
Hepsey Burke&#8217;s different. I wonder if&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he put he thought away from him with a &#8220;get
thee behind me&#8221; abruptness, and putting on his coat,
went out to water the stock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE MISSIONARY TEA</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Mrs. Burke remarked to Maxwell
abruptly one day during supper. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t had a missionary tea since you
came, and I think it&#8217;s high time we did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a missionary tea do you mean?&#8221;
the parson inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mrs. Burke responded, &#8220;our missionary
teas combine different attractions. We get together
and look over each other&#8217;s clothes; that&#8217;s the first
thing; then some one reads a paper reportin&#8217; how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
things is goin&#8217; in Zanzibar, or what&#8217;s doin&#8217; in Timbuctoo.
Then we look over the old clothes sent in
for missionaries, mend &#8217;em up, and get &#8217;em ready to
send off. Then we have tea and cake. I&#8217;ve had my
misgivin&#8217; for some time that perhaps we cared more
for the tea and cake than we did for the heathen; but
of course I put such a wicked thought aside. If you
value your reputation for piety, don&#8217;t you ever speak
of a missionary tea here except in a whisper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I suppose the tea helps to get people together
and be more sociable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. The next best thing to religion is a
cup of strong tea and a frosted cake, to make us
country people friends. Both combined can&#8217;t be beat.
But you ought to see the things that have been sent
in this last week for the missionary box. There&#8217;s a
smoking jacket, two pairs of golf-trousers, several
pairs of mismated gloves, a wonderful lot of undarned
stockings, bonnets and underclothes to burn,
two jackets and a bathin&#8217; suit. I wonder what people
think missionaries are doin&#8217; most of the time!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the missionary tea the
ladies were to assemble at Thunder Cliff at four
o&#8217;clock; and when Maxwell came home, before the
advent of the first guest, he seemed somewhat depressed;
and Mrs. Burke inquired:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Been makin&#8217; calls on your parishioners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have made a few visits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must look more cheerful, or somebody&#8217;ll
suspect that you don&#8217;t always find parish calls the joy
of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so difficult to find subjects of conversation
that they are interested in. I simply couldn&#8217;t draw
out Mrs. Snodgrass, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you&#8217;ve lived in the country as long as
I have, you&#8217;ll find that the one unfailin&#8217; subject of
interest is symptoms&mdash;mostly dyspepsy and liver complaint.
If you had known enough to have started
right with Elmira Snodgrass, she would have thawed
out at once. Elmira is always lookin&#8217; for trouble as
the sparks fly upwards, or thereabouts. She&#8217;d crawl
through a barbed wire fence if she couldn&#8217;t get at it
any other way. She always chews a pill on principle,
and then she calls it a dispensation of Providence,
and wonders why she was ever born to be tormented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; laughed Maxwell, &#8220;I&#8217;d better get
some medical books and read up on symptoms. By
the by, is there any particular program for this missionary
meeting, Mrs. Burke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Virginia Bascom&#8217;s goin&#8217; to read a paper
called &#8216;The Christian Mother as a Missionary in her
own Household.&#8217; To be sure, Ginty&#8217;s no Christian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Mother, or any other kind of a mother; but she&#8217;s as
full of enthusiasm as a shad is of bones. She&#8217;d bring
up any child while you wait, and not charge a cent.
There goes the bell, so please excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guests were received by Mrs. Burke. Miss
Bascom entered the parlor with a portentous bundle
of manuscript under her arm, and greeted Donald
with a radiant smile. Pulling a pansy from a bunch
in her dress, she adjusted it in his buttonhole with the
happy shyness of a young kitten chasing its tail. After
the others had assembled, they formed a circle to inspect
the clothing which had been sent in. There
was a general buzz of conversation.</p>
<p>As they were busily going through the garments,
Virginia remarked, &#8220;Are all these things to go to the
missionaries at Tien Tsin?&#8221; and she adjusted her
lorgnette to inspect the heap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Burke responded wearily, &#8220;and I hope
they&#8217;ll get what comfort they can out of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to be very appreciative, Mrs.
Burke,&#8221; Virginia reproved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I ought to be satisfied,&#8221; Hepsey
replied. &#8220;But it does seem as if most people give to
the Lord what they can&#8217;t use for themselves any
longer&mdash;as they would to a poor relation that&#8217;s
worthy, but not to be coddled by too much charity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think these things are quite nice enough for the
missionaries,&#8221; Virginia retorted. &#8220;They are thankful
for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; Mrs. Burke replied calmly. &#8220;Missionaries
and their families have no business to have
any feelings that can&#8217;t be satisfied with second-hand
clothes, and no end of good advice on how to spend
five cents freely but not extravagantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you believe in sending them useful
things?&#8221; Virginia asked loftily.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I do; but I&#8217;d hate that word &#8216;useful&#8217; if I was
a missionary&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I inquire,&#8221; asked Miss Bascom meekly,
&#8220;what you would send?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! I&#8217;d send a twenty-five-cent scent bag,
made of silk and filled with patchouli-powder,&#8221; said
Hepsey, squarely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Virginia added devoutly, &#8220;satchet bags
may be well enough in their place; but they won&#8217;t feed
missionaries, or clothe them, or save souls, you know,
Mrs. Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody say they would?&#8221; Mrs. Burke inquired.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t particularly care to see missionaries
clothed in sachet bags myself; the smell might
drive the heathen to desperation. But do we always
limit our spending money to necessary clothes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
food? The truth is, we all of us spend anything we
like as long as it goes on our backs, or down our
throats; but the moment it comes to supportin&#8217;
missionaries we think &#8217;em worldly and graspin&#8217;
if they show any ambition beyond second-hand
clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live up to your preachin&#8217;, Mrs. Burke?&#8221;
a little sallow-faced woman inquired from a dark corner
of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it hits me just as hard as anybody else,
as Martin Luther said. But I&#8217;ve got a proposition
to make: if you&#8217;ll take these things you brought, back
with you, and wear &#8217;em for a week just as they are,
and play you&#8217;re the missionaries, I&#8217;ll take back all
I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>
<p>As, however, there was no response to this challenge,
the box was packed, and the cover nailed down.</p>
<p>(It is perhaps no proper part of this story to add,
that its opening on the other side of the world was
attended by the welcome and surprising fragrance of
patchouli, emanating from a little silk sachet secreted
among the more workaday gifts.)</p>
<p>The ladies then adjourned to the front piazza,
where the supper was served.</p>
<p>When the dishes had been cleared away, the guests
adjusted their chairs and assumed attitudes of expectant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
attention while Virginia stood up and shyly
unrolled her manuscript, with a placid, self-conscious
smile on her countenance. She apologized for her
youth and inexperience, with a moving glance towards
her pastor, and then got down to business. She began
with the original and striking remark that it was the
chief glory and function of woman to be a home-maker.
She continued with something to the effect
that the woman who forms the character of her children
in the sanctity of the home-life rules the destinies
of the world. Then she made a fetching allusion to
the &#8220;Mother of the Gracchi,&#8221; and said something
about jewels. Nobody knew who the &#8220;Gracchi&#8221; were,
but they supposed that they must be some relatives
of Virginia&#8217;s who lived in Boston.</p>
<p>She asserted that the modern methods of bringing
up children were all wrong. She drew a striking picture
of the ideal home in which children always stood
modestly and reverently by their parents&#8217; chairs, consumed
with anxiety to be of some service to their elders.
They were always to be immaculately neat in
their attire, and gentle in their ways. The use of
slang was quite beneath them.</p>
<p>These ideal children were always to spend their
evenings at home in the perusal of instructive books,
and the pursuit of useful knowledge. Then, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
half-past seven arrived, they were to rise spontaneously
and promptly, and bid their parents an affectionate
good-night, and retire to their rooms, where,
having said their prayers and recited the golden text,
they were to get into bed.</p>
<p>Portions of Virginia&#8217;s essay were quite moving.
Speaking of the rewards which good mothers reap,
in the virtues and graces of their dutiful offspring, she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;What mother does not feel a thrill of exquisite
rapture as she fondly gazes into the depths of her
baby&#8217;s eyes and sees there the budding promise of
glorious womanhood. What mother does not watch
the development of her little son with wondering
pride, as she notes his manly, simple ways, his gentle
reverence, his tender, modest behavior. What mother&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Virginia came to an abrupt stop, for there
was a terrible racket somewhere overhead on the
piazza roof; a rope was suddenly dropped over the
edge of the eaves, and almost immediately a pair of
very immodestly bare legs were lowered into view,
followed by the rest of Nickey Burke&#8217;s person, attired
in his nightshirt. It was the work of a moment
for the nimble boy to slide down the rope onto the
ground. But, as he landed on his feet, finding himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
in the august presence of the missionary circle, he remarked
&#8220;Gee Whitaker bee&#8217;s wax!&#8221; and prudently
took to his heels, and sped around the house as if he
had been shot out of a gun.</p>
<p>Several segments of the circle giggled violently.
The essayist, though very red, made a brave effort to
ignore the highly indecorous interruption, and so continued
with trembling tones:</p>
<p>&#8220;What more beautiful and touching thing is there,
than the innocent, unsullied modesty of childhood?
One might almost say&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But she never said it, for here again she was forced
to pause while another pair of immodest legs appeared
over the eaves, much fatter and shorter than
the preceding pair. These belonged to Nickey&#8217;s boon-companion,
the gentle Oliver Wendell Jones. The
rest of O. W. J. followed in due time; and, quite
ignorant of what awaited him, he began his wriggling
descent. Most unfortunately for him, the hem of
his nightshirt caught on a large nail in the eaves of
the roof; and after a frantic, fruitless, and fearful
effort to disconnect himself, he hung suspended in the
breeze for one awful moment, like a painted cherub
on a Christmas tree, while his mother, recognizing
her offspring, rose to go to his assistance.</p>
<p>Then there was a frantic yell, a terrible ripping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
sound, and Oliver Wendell was seen to drop to the
ground clad in the sleeves and the front breadth of
his shirt, while the entire back of it, from the collar
down, waved triumphantly aloft from the eaves.
Oliver Wendell Jones picked himself up, unhurt, but
much frightened, and very angry: presenting much the
aspect of a punctured tire. Then suddenly discovering
the proximity of the missionary circle and missing
the rear elevation of his shirt about the same time,
in the horror and mortification of the moment, he lost
his head entirely. Notwithstanding the protests of
his pursuing mother, without waiting for his clothes,
he fled, &#8220;anywhere, anywhere out of the world,&#8221;
bawling with wrath and chagrin.</p>
<p>The entire circumference of the missionary circle
now burst into roars of laughter. His mother quickly
overtook and captured Oliver, tying her apron around
his neck as a concession to the popular prejudice
against &#8220;the altogether.&#8221; The gravity of the missionary
circle was so thoroughly demoralized that it
was impossible to restore order; and Miss Bascom,
in the excess of her mortification, stuffed the rest of
her manuscript, its eloquent peroration undelivered,
into her bag.</p>

&#8220;NICHOLAS BURKE, WHAT IN THE NAME OF CONSCIENCE DOES ALL THIS IDIOTIC PERFORMANCE MEAN, I&#8217;D LIKE TO KNOW?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>When the last guest had departed, Mrs. Burke
proceeded to hunt up Nickey, who was dressed and
sitting on the top of the corn-crib whittling a stick.
His mother began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Burke, what in the name of conscience
does all this idiotic performance mean, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nickey closed his knife. Gazing serenely down at
his mother, he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I know the blamed missionary push was
goin&#8217; to meet on the front porch, I&#8217;d like to know?
Me and Oliver Wendell was just playin&#8217; the house
was on fire. We&#8217;d gone to bed in the front room, and
then I told Ollie the fire was breakin&#8217; out all around
us, and the sparks was flyin&#8217;, and the stairs was
burned away, and there was no way of &#8217;scapin&#8217; but
to slide down the rope over the roof. I &#8217;aint to blame
for his nightshirt bein&#8217; caught on a nail, and bein&#8217;
ripped off him. Maybe the ladies was awful shocked;
but they laughed fit to split their sides just the same.
Mr. Maxwell laughed louder than &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey retired hastily, lest her face should relax
its well-assumed severity.</p>
<p>Maxwell, in the meantime, felt it a part of his duty
to console and soothe the ruffled feelings of his zealous
and fluent parishioner, and to Virginia&#8217;s pride his
offer of escort to Willow Bluff was ample reparation
for the untoward interruption of her oratory. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
delivered into his hands, with sensitive upward glance,
the receptacle containing her manuscript, and set a
brisk pace, at which she insured the passing of the
other guests along the road, making visible her triumph
over circumstance and at the same time obviating
untimely intrusion of a tete-a-tete conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have given a great deal of time and
study to your subject,&#8221; remarked Maxwell politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very near to my heart,&#8221; responded Virginia,
in welling tones. &#8220;Home-life is, to me, almost a religion.
Do you not feel, with me, that it is the most
valuable of human qualities, Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do indeed, and one of the most difficult to reduce
to a science,&#8221;&mdash;she glanced up at him apprehensively,
whereupon, lest he seemed to have erred in fact,
he added,&mdash;&#8220;as you made us realize in your
paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so nice to have your appreciation,&#8221; she gurgled.
&#8220;Often I feel it almost futile to try to influence
our cold parish audiences; their attitude is so
stolid, so unimaginative. As you must have realized,
in the pulpit, they are so hard to lead into untrodden
paths. Let us take the way home by the lane,&#8221; she
added coyly, leading off the road down a sheltered
by-way.</p>
<p>The lane was rough, and the lady, tightly and lightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
shod, stumbled neatly and grasped her escort&#8217;s arm
for support&mdash;and retained it for comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;What horizons your sermons have spread before
us&mdash;and, yet,&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated,&mdash;&#8220;I often wonder, as
my eyes wander over the congregation, how many besides
myself, really hear your message, really see
what <i>you</i> see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand trembled on his arm, and Maxwell was
a little at a loss, though anxious not to seem unresponsive
to Virginia&#8217;s enthusiasm for spiritual vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that my first attention has to be given to
the simpler problems, here in Durford,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But I am glad if I haven&#8217;t been dull, in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dull? No indeed&mdash;how can you say that! To
my life&mdash;you will understand?&#8221; (she glanced up with
tremulous flutter of eyelids) &#8220;&mdash;you have brought so
much helpfulness and&mdash;and warmth.&#8221; She sighed
eloquently.</p>
<p>Maxwell was no egotist, and was always prone to
see only an impersonal significance in parish compliments.
A more self-conscious subject for confidences
would have replied less openly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad&mdash;very glad. But you must not think
that the help has been one-sided. You have seconded
my efforts so energetically&mdash;indeed I don&#8217;t know
what I could have accomplished without such whole-hearted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
help as you and Mrs. Burke and others have
given.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the optimistic Virginia the division of the loaves
and fishes of his personal gratitude was scarcely heeded.
She cherished her own portion, and soon magnified
it to a basketful&mdash;and soon, again, to a monopoly
of the entire supply. As he gave her his hand at the
door of Willow Bluff, she was in fit state to invest
that common act of friendliness with symbolic significance
of a rosy future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HEPSEY GOES A-FISHING</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Burke seemed incapable of sitting still,
with folded hands, for any length of time;
and when the stress of her attention to household
work, and her devotion to neighborly good deeds
relaxed, she turned to knitting wash-rags as a sportsman
turns to his gun, or a toper to his cups. She
seemed to find more stimulus for thought and more
helpful diversion in the production of one wash-rag
than most persons find in a trip abroad.</p>
<p>One day, not very long after the eventful missionary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
tea, she was sitting in her garden, and knitting
more rapidly than usual, as she said to Maxwell:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been the matter with you these last few
weeks? You&#8217;ve been lookin&#8217; altogether too sober,
and you don&#8217;t eat nothin&#8217; to speak of. It must be
either liver, or conscience, or heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretly, she strongly suspected a cardiac affection,
of the romantic variety. She intended to investigate.</p>
<p>Donald laughed as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s all three together; but I&#8217;m all right.
There&#8217;s nothing the matter with me. Every man has
his blue days, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the last month you&#8217;ve had too many; and
there must be some reason for it. There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; so
refreshin&#8217; as gettin&#8217; away from your best friends, once
in a while. I guess you need a change&mdash;pinin&#8217; for
the city, maybe. Sakes alive! I can&#8217;t see how folks
can live that way&mdash;all crowded up together, like a lot
of prisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care to visit in the city, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a change is good for everyone. Don&#8217;t you
ever get away from Durford for a few weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very often. What with decidin&#8217; where to go,
and fussin&#8217; to get ready, and shuttin&#8217; up the house,
it&#8217;s more trouble than its worth. Then there&#8217;s so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
many things to &#8217;tend to when you get home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you ever visit relatives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life, unless I&#8217;m subp&oelig;na-ed by the
coroner: though of course we do get together to celebrate
a family funeral or a wedding now and then.
Visitin&#8217; is no joke, I tell you. No sir, I&#8217;m old enough
to know when I&#8217;m well off, and home&#8217;s the best place
for me. I want my own table, and my own bed when
it comes night.&#8221; She paused, and then remarked meditatively:</p>
<p>&#8220;I went down to visit in New York once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you enjoy your visit?&#8221; Maxwell inquired.
&#8220;New York&#8217;s my home-city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I did, awful much. You see, I was
visitin&#8217; Sally Ramsdale&mdash;Sally Greenway that was.
They were livin&#8217; in an apartment, ninth floor up. In
the first place, I didn&#8217;t like goin&#8217; up stairs in the elevator.
I was so scared, I felt as if the end had come,
and I was bein&#8217; jerked to my reward in an iron birdcage
with a small kid dressed in brass buttons. When
I got into the hall it was about two feet wide and
darker than Pharaoh&#8217;s conscience. It had a string of
cells along the side, and one opened into a chimney,
and the rest into nothin&#8217; in particular. The middle
cell was a dinin&#8217; room where we ate when we could
find the way to our mouths. Near as I can recollect,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
you got into the parlor through the pantry, back of
the servant&#8217;s room, by jumpin&#8217; over five trunks. You
ought to have seen my room. It looked just like a
parlor when you first went in. There was somethin&#8217;
lookin&#8217; like a cross between an upright piano and
writin&#8217; desk. Sally gave it a twist, and it tumbled
out into a folding bed. The first night, I laid awake
with my eyes on the foot of that bed expectin&#8217; it to
rise and stand me on my head; but it didn&#8217;t. You
took the book of poems off the center table, gave it a
flop, and it was a washstand. Everything seemed to
shut up into something else it hadn&#8217;t ought to. It
was a &#8216;now you see it, and now you don&#8217;t see it,&#8217; kind
of a room; and I seemed to be foldin&#8217; and unfoldin&#8217;
most of the time. Then the ceilin&#8217; was so low that
you could hardly get the cover off the soap dish. I
felt all the while as if I should smother. My! but
I was glad to get home and get a breath of real air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Maxwell replied, &#8220;people live more natural
and healthful lives in the country. The advantages
of the city aren&#8217;t an unmixed blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough. That&#8217;s no way to live. Just
think of havin&#8217; no yard but a window box and a fire
escape! I&#8217;d smother!</p>
<p>&#8220;We folks out here in the country &#8217;aint enjoyin&#8217;
a lot of the refinements of city life; anyhow we get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
along, and the funny part about it is,&mdash;it &#8217;aint hard
to do, either. In the first place we &#8217;aint so particular,
which helps a lot, and besides, as Jonathan Jackson
used to say,&mdash;there&#8217;s compensations. I had one look
at Fifth Avenue and I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; it wasn&#8217;t all I
had heard it was; but if I had to look at it three
hundred and sixty-five days a year I wouldn&#8217;t trade it
for this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, some days it rains up here, but I can sit at
my window and look down the valley, to where the
creek runs through, and &#8217;way up into the timber, and
the sight of all those green things, livin&#8217; and noddin&#8217;
in the rain is a long ways from being disheartenin&#8217;,&mdash;and
when the sun shines I can sit out here, in my
garden, with my flowers, and watch the boys playin&#8217;
down in the meadow, Bascom&#8217;s Holsteins grazin&#8217;
over there on the hill, and the air full of the perfume
of growin&#8217; things,&mdash;they &#8217;aint got anything like that,
in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a time Mrs. Burke relapsed into silence, while
Maxwell smoked his briar pipe as he lay on the grass
near by. She realized that the parson had cleverly
side-tracked her original subject of conversation, and
as she glanced down at him she shook her head with
droll deprecation of his guile.</p>
<p>When she first accused him of the blues, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
true that Maxwell&#8217;s look had expressed glum depression.
Now, he was smiling, and, balked of her prey,
Mrs. Burke knitted briskly, contemplating other
means drawing him from his covert. Her strategy
had been too subtle: she would try a frontal attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever think of gettin&#8217; married, Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;
she inquired abruptly.</p>
<p>For an instant Maxwell colored; but he blew two
or three rings of smoke in the air, and then replied
carelessly, as he plucked at the grass by his side:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes: every fellow of my age has fancied himself
in love some time or other, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s like measles, or whoopin&#8217;-cough; every
man has to have it sometime; but you haven&#8217;t answered
my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suppose I was in love; a man must be pretty
conceited to imagine that he could make up to a girl
for the sacrifice of bringing her to live in a place like
Durford. That sounds horribly rude to Durford,
but you won&#8217;t misunderstand me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I know exactly how you feel; but the average
girl is just dyin&#8217; to make a great sacrifice for some
good-lookin&#8217; young fellow, all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes; the <i>average</i> girl; but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell&#8217;s voice trailed off into silence, while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
affected to gaze stonily into the blue deeps of the sky
overhead.</p>
<p>Hepsey had thought herself a pretty clever fisherman,
in her day; evidently, she decided, this particular
fish was not going to be easy to land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think a clergyman is better off married?&#8221;
she asked, presently.</p>
<p>Donald knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put
it in his pocket, clasped his hands across his knees,
and smiled thoughtfully for a moment. There was
a light in his eyes which was good to see, and a slight
trembling of his lips before he ventured to speak.
Then he sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, on many accounts. But I think that
any parson in a place like this ought to know and face
all the difficulties of the situation before he comes to
a definite decision and marries. Isn&#8217;t that your own
view? You&#8217;ve had experience of married parsons
here: what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see the matter is just like this: Every
parish wants an unmarried parson; the vestry &#8217;cause
he&#8217;s cheap, every unmarried woman &#8217;cause he may be
a possible suitor; and it&#8217;s easier to run him than it
is a married man. He may be decent, well-bred and
educated. And he comes to a parcel of ignoramuses
who think they know ten times as much as he does.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
If he can&#8217;t earn enough to marry on, and has the good
sense to keep out of matrimony, the people talk
about his bein&#8217; a selfish old bachelor who neglects his
duty to society. He can&#8217;t afford to run a tumble-down
rectory like ours. If in the face of all this
he marries, he has to scrimp and stint until it is a
question of buyin&#8217; one egg or two, and lettin&#8217; his wife
worry and work until she&#8217;s fit for a lunatic asylum.
No business corporation, not even a milk-peddlin&#8217;
trust, would treat its men so or expect good work
from &#8217;em. Then the average layman seldom thinks
how he can help the parson. His one idea is to be a
kicker as long as he can think of anything to kick
about. The only man in this parish who never kicks
is paralyzed in both legs. Yes sir; the parson of the
country parish is the parish goat, as the sayin&#8217; is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke ceased her tirade, and after a while
Maxwell remarked quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, I&#8217;m afraid you are a pessimist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no such thing,&#8221; she retorted hotly. &#8220;A pessimist&#8217;s
a man that sees nothin&#8217; but the bad, and says
there&#8217;s no help for it and won&#8217;t raise a hand: he&#8217;s a
proper sour-belly. An optimist&#8217;s a man that sees
nothin&#8217; but the good, and says everything&#8217;s all right;
let&#8217;s have a good time. Poor fool! The practical
man&mdash;anyway, the practical woman&mdash;sees both the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
bad and the good, and says we can make things a
whole lot better if we try; let&#8217;s take off our coats and
hustle to beat the cars, and see what happens. The
real pessimists are your Bascoms, and that kind:
and I guess I pity him more than blame him: he seems
as lonesome as a tooth-pick in a cider-barrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought that Bascom was a wealthy man.
He ought to be able to help out, and raise money
enough so that the town could keep a parson and his
wife comfortably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing! But the church isn&#8217;t supported by
tight-fisted wealthy people. It&#8217;s the hard-workin&#8217;
middle class who are willin&#8217; to turn in and spend their
last cent for the church. And don&#8217;t you get me started
on Bascom as you value your life. Maybe I&#8217;ll
swear a blue streak before I get through: not but
what I suppose that even Bascom has his good points&mdash;like
a porcupine. But a little emery paper on Bascom&#8217;s
good points wouldn&#8217;t hurt &#8217;em very much.
They&#8217;re awful rusty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well! Money isn&#8217;t all there is in life,&#8221; soothed
Maxwell, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not quite; but it&#8217;s a mighty good thing to
have in the house. You&#8217;d think so if you had to wear
the same hat three summers. I&#8217;ve got to that time
in my life where I can get along very well without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
most of the necessities; but I must have a few luxuries
to keep me goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think that a clergyman ought not to
marry and bring his wife to a place like Durford?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything of the sort. If you was to
get married I&#8217;d see you through, if it broke my neck
or Bascom&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, you seem to me a bit illogical?&#8221; remarked
Maxwell mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me about logic! The strongest argument
is often the biggest lie. There are times in your
life when you have to take your fate in both hands
and shut your eyes, and jump in the dark. Maybe
you&#8217;ll land on your feet, and maybe you&mdash;won&#8217;t. But
you have got to jump just the same. That&#8217;s matrimony&mdash;common
sense, idiocy, or whatever you
choose to call it.... I never could tell which. It&#8217;s
the only thing to do; and any man with a backbone
and a fist won&#8217;t hesitate very long. If you marry, I&#8217;ll
see you through; though of course you won&#8217;t stay here
long, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awfully kind, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; Maxwell replied,
&#8220;and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t forget your promise&mdash;when the
time comes for me to take the momentous step. But
I think it would be the wisest thing for me to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
my heart free for a while; or at any rate, not to get
married.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke looked down at her rector, and smiled
broadly at his clever evasion of the bait she had dangled
before him so persistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do as you like; but that reminds me that
when next you go to town you&#8217;ll need to get a new
glass for that miniature of your sister. You must
have dozed off with it in your hands last night and
dropped it. I found it this morning on the floor
alongside of your chair, with the glass broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose triumphantly, as she knitted the last stitch
of the wash-rag. &#8220;Excuse me&mdash;I must go and peel
the potatoes for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d offer to contribute to the menu, by catching
some fish for you; but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a very good
day for fishing, is it, Mrs. Burke?&#8221; asked Maxwell
innocently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN ICEBOX FOR CHERUBIM</h3>
</div>
<p>As we have seen, when Maxwell began his work
in Durford, he was full of the enthusiasm of
youth and inexperience. He was, however,
heartily supported and encouraged in his efforts by
all but Sylvester Bascom. Without being actively and
openly hostile, the Senior Warden, under the guise of
superior wisdom and a judicial regard for expediency,
managed to thwart many of his projects. After each
interview with Bascom, Maxwell felt that every bit
of life and heart had been pumped out of him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
that he was very young, and very foolish to attempt
to make any change in &#8220;the good old ways&#8221; of the
parish, which for so many years had stunted its
growth and had acquired the immobility of the laws
of the Medes and Persians.</p>
<p>But there was one parishioner who was ever ready
to suggest new ventures to &#8220;elevate&#8221; the people, and
to play the part of intimate friend and adviser to her
good-looking rector, and that was Virginia Bascom.
For some unknown reason &#8220;the people&#8221; did not seem
to be acutely anxious thus to be elevated; and most
of them seemed to regard Virginia as a harmless idiot
with good intentions, but with positive genius for
meddling in other people&#8217;s affairs. Being the only
daughter of the Senior Warden, and the leading lady
from a social standpoint, she considered that she had
a roving commission to set people right at a moment&#8217;s
notice; and there were comparatively few people in
Durford on whom she had not experimented in one
way or another. She organized a Browning club to
keep the factory girls out of the streets evenings, a
mothers&#8217; meeting, an ethical culture society, and a
craftman&#8217;s club, and, as she was made president of
each, her time was quite well filled.</p>
<p>And now in her fertile brain dawned a brilliant idea,
which she proceeded to propound to the rector. Maxwell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
was non-committal, for he felt the matter was
one for feminine judgment. Then she decided to
consult Mrs. Burke&mdash;because, while Hepsey was &#8220;not
in society,&#8221; she was recognized as the dominant personality
among the women of the village, and no parish
enterprise amounted to much unless she approved
of it, and was gracious enough to assist. As Virginia
told Maxwell, &#8220;Mrs. Burke has a talent of
persuasiveness,&#8221; and so was &#8220;useful in any emergency.&#8221;
If Mrs. Burke&#8217;s sympathies could be enlisted
on behalf of the new scheme it would be bound
to succeed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Mrs. Burke had heard rumors
of this new project of Virginia&#8217;s. It always went
against the grain with Hepsey to say: &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;
She was a firm believer in the teaching of experience:
&#8220;Experience does it,&#8221; was her translation of
the classic adage.</p>
<p>And so one morning found Virginia sitting opposite
Mrs. Burke in the kitchen at Thunder Cliff, knitting
her brows and poking the toe of her boot with
the end of her parasol in an absent-minded way. This
was symptomatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything on your mind, Virginia? What&#8217;s up
now?&#8221; Mrs. Burke began.</p>
<p>For a moment Virginia hesitated, and then replied:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking of establishing a day-nursery to
care for the babies of working women, Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke, with hands on her hips, gazed intently
at her visitor, pushed up her under lip, scowled,
and then observed thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder some one hasn&#8217;t thought of that before.
Who&#8217;s to take care of the babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Quinn and I, with the assistance of others,
of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure that you know which is the business
end of a nursing-bottle? Could you put a safety-pin
where it would do the most good? Could you wash a
baby without drownin&#8217; it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I have not had much experience,&#8221; Virginia
replied in a dignified and lofty way, &#8220;but Mary
Quinn has, and she could teach me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinkin&#8217;, I suppose, that a day-nursery
would fill a long-felt want, or somethin&#8217; like that.
Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to pay the bills?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there ought to be enough progressive, philanthropic
people in Durford to subscribe the necessary
funds, you know. It is to be an auxiliary to the parish
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! What does Mr. Maxwell say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he said that he supposed that babies were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
good things in their way; but he hadn&#8217;t seen many
in the village, and he didn&#8217;t quite realize what help
a day-nursery would be to the working women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound mighty enthusiastic. Maybe
we might get the money; but who&#8217;s to subscribe the
babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the working women, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t subscribe &#8217;em if they haven&#8217;t got &#8217;em.
There are mighty few kids in this town; and if you
really want my candid opinion, I don&#8217;t think Durford
needs a day-nursery any more than it needs an icebox
for cherubim. But then of course that doesn&#8217;t
matter much. When you goin&#8217; to begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next Monday. We have rented the store where
Elkin&#8217;s grocery used to be, and we are going to fit
it up with cribs, and all the most up-to-date conveniences
for a sanitary day-nursery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Well, I&#8217;ll do all I can to help you, of
course. I suppose you&#8217;ll find babies pushin&#8217; all over
the sidewalk Monday mornin&#8217;, comin&#8217; early to avoid
the rush. Better get down as early as possible, Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia departed.</p>
<p>After the furnishing of the incipient nursery had
been completed, and each little crib had a new unbreakable
doll whose cheeks were decorated with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
unsuckable paint, Virginia and Mary Quinn&mdash;invaluable
in undertaking the spadework of all Virginia&#8217;s
parish exploits&mdash;gave an afternoon tea to which all
the subscribers and their friends were invited. But
when everything was in readiness for patronage, what
few working women there were in Durford, possessed
of the right kind of babies, seemed strangely reluctant
to trust their youthful offspring to the tender
mercies of Virginia Bascom and Mary Quinn.</p>
<p>Consequently, the philanthropic movement, started
under such favorable patronage, soon reached a critical
stage in its career, and Mrs. Burke was called in
to contribute some practical suggestions. She responded
to the summons with all due promptness,
and when she arrived at the nursery, she smilingly
remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! But where are the babies? I thought they
would be swarming all over the place like tadpoles
in a pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; Virginia began, her voice quivering
with disappointment, &#8220;Mary Quinn and I have
been sitting here four mortal days, and not a single
infant has appeared on the scene. I must say that
the working women of Durford seem strangely unappreciative
of our efforts to help them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mrs. Burke responded, &#8220;I suppose day-nurseries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
without babies are as incomplete as an incubator
without eggs. But after all, it hardly seems
worth while to go out and snatch nursing infants
from their mother&#8217;s breasts just to fill a long-felt
want, does it? Besides, you might get yourself into
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask you to come and make fun of me,&#8221;
Virginia replied touchily. &#8220;I wanted you to make
some suggestions to help us out. If we don&#8217;t get any
babies, we might just as well close our doors at once.
I should be awfully mortified to have the whole thing
a failure, after all we have done, and all the advertising
we have had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke sat down and assumed a very judicial
expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ginty dear, I&#8217;m awful sorry for you; I
don&#8217;t doubt you done the best you could. It&#8217;d be
unreasonable to expect you to collect babies like
mushrooms in a single night. All true reformers are
bound to strike snags, and to suffer because they aint
appreciated in their own day and generation. It&#8217;s
only after we are gone and others take our places that
the things we do are appreciated. You&#8217;ll have to
resign yourself to fate, Virginia, and wait for what
the newspapers call &#8216;the vindicatin&#8217; verdict of prosperity.&#8217;
Think of all the people that tried to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
things and didn&#8217;t do &#8217;em. Now there&#8217;s the Christian
martyrs&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason Virginia seemed to have a vague
suspicion that Hepsey was still making fun of her;
and being considerably nettled, she interjected tartly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not working for the verdict of posterity, and
I don&#8217;t care a flip for the Christian martyrs. I&#8217;m
trying to conduct a day-nursery, here and now; we
have the beds, and the equipment, and some money,
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t got the babies, Virginia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely, Mrs. Burke. It&#8217;s simply a question of
babies, now or never. Babies we must have or close
our doors. I must confess that I am greatly pained
at the lack of interest of the community in our humble
efforts to serve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some time Hepsey sat in silence; then she
smiled as if a bright idea occurred to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not borrow a few babies from the mothers in
town, Virginia? You see, you might offer to pay a
small rental by the hour, or take out a lease which
could be renewed when it expired. What is lacking
is public confidence in your enterprise. If you and
Miss Quinn could be seen in the nursery windows
dandlin&#8217; a baby on each arm, and singin&#8217; lullabies to
&#8217;em for a few days, it&#8217;d attract attention, inspire faith
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in the timid, and public confidence would be restored.
The tide of babies&#8217;d turn your way after a while,
and the nursery would prove a howlin&#8217; success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia considered the suggestion and, after deep
thought, remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think we ought to pay for the loan
of a baby per hour, Mrs. Burke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I haven&#8217;t had much experience
rentin&#8217; babies, as I have been busy payin&#8217; taxes and
insurance on my own for some years; then you see
rents have gone up like everything lately. But I
should think that ten cents an afternoon ought to be
sufficient. I think I might be able to hunt up a baby
or two. Mrs. Warren might lend her baby, and perhaps
Mrs. Fletcher might add her twins. I&#8217;ll call on
them at once, if you say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia looked relieved, and in a voice of gratitude
responded:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are really very, very kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, cheer up, Virginia; cheer up. Every cloud
has its silver linin&#8217;; and I guess we can find some
babies somewhere even if we have to advertise in
the papers. Now I must be goin&#8217;, and I&#8217;ll stop on
the way and make a bid for the Fletcher twins. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Nicholas Burke learned from his mother of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
the quest of the necessary babies, he started out of
his own motion and was the first to arrive on the
scene with the spoils of victory, in the shape of the
eighteen-months infant of Mrs. Thomas McCarthy,
for which he had been obliged to pay twenty-five
cents in advance, the infant protesting vigorously with
all the power of a well developed pair of lungs. As
Nickey delivered the goods, he remarked casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Virginia, you just take the darn thing
quick. He&#8217;s been howlin&#8217; to beat the band.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nickey,&#8221; exclaimed Virginia, entranced, and
gingerly possessing herself of James McCarthy,
&#8220;however did you get him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His ma wouldn&#8217;t let me have him at first; and it
took an awful lot of jollyin&#8217; to bring her round. Of
course I didn&#8217;t mean to tell no lies, but I said you
was awful fond of kids. I said that if you only had
Jimmy, it would give the nursery a dandy send-off,
&#8217;cause she was so well known, and Mr. McCarthy
was such a prominent citizen. When she saw me
cough up a quarter and play with it right under her
nose, I could see she was givin&#8217; in; and she says to
me, &#8216;Nickey, you can take him just this once. I&#8217;d like
to help the good cause along, and Miss Bascom, she
means well.&#8217; Ma&#8217;s gettin&#8217; after the Fletcher twins
for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>James McCarthy was welcomed with open arms,
was washed and dressed in the most approved antiseptic
manner; his gums were swabed with boracic
acid, and he was fed from a sterilized bottle on Pasteurized
milk, and tucked up in a crib with carbolized
sheets, and placed close to the window where he
could bask in actinic rays, and inhale ozone to his
heart&#8217;s content. Thus the passer-by could see at a
glance that the good work had begun to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke managed to get hold of the Fletcher
twins, and as they both howled lustily in unison, all
the time, they added much to the natural domesticity
of the scene and seemed to invite further patronage,
like barkers at a side-show. Mrs. Warren was also
persuaded.</p>
<p>Although the village was thoroughly canvassed,
Miss Bascom was obliged to content herself with the
McCarthy baby and the Fletcher twins, and the Warren
baby, until, one morning, a colored woman appeared
with a bundle in her arms. As she was the
first voluntary contributor of live stock, she was
warmly welcomed, and a great fuss made over the
tiny black infant which gradually emerged from the
folds of an old shawl &#8220;like a cuckoo out of its
cocoon,&#8221; as Mary Quinn remarked. This, of course,
was very nice and encouraging, but most unfortunately,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
when night came, the mother did not appear
to claim her progeny, nor did she ever turn up again.
Of course it was a mere oversight on her part, but
Virginia was much disturbed, for, to her very great
embarrassment, she found herself the undisputed possessor
of a coal black baby. She was horrified beyond
measure, and sent at once for Mrs. Burke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do, what shall I do, Mrs. Burke?&#8221;
she cried. Mrs. Burke gazed musingly at the writhing
black blot on the white and rose blanket, and suggested:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity you couldn&#8217;t adopt it, Virginia. You always
loved children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adopt it!&#8221; Virginia screamed hysterically. &#8220;What
in the world can you be thinking of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t think of anything else, unless I can
persuade Andy Johnston, the colored man on the
farm, to adopt it. He wouldn&#8217;t mind its complexion
as much as you seem to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia brightened considerably at this suggestion,
exclaiming excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Mrs. Burke, do you really think you could?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps so. At any rate,
if we offer to help pay the extra expense, Mrs. Johnston
might bring the baby up as her own. Then they
can name it Virginia Bascom Johnston, you see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Virginia bit her lip, but she managed to control her
temper as she exclaimed quite cheerfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, you are so very kind. You are always
helping somebody out of a scrape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t overpraise me, Virginia. My head&#8217;s easily
turned. The teachin&#8217;s of experience are hard&mdash;but I
guess they&#8217;re best in the end. Well, send the poor
little imp of darkness round to me to-night, and I&#8217;ll
see that it has good care.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Hepsey had qualms of conscience
as to whether she should not, at the outset,
have discouraged the whole baby project; experience
threatened to give its lesson by pretty hard knocks,
on this occasion.</p>
<p>For though the immediate problem was thus easily
solved, others presented themselves to vex the philanthropic
Virginia.</p>
<p>When on the tenth day the rental for the Warren
baby and the Fletcher twins fell due, and the lease of
James McCarthy expired without privilege of renewal,
the finances of the nursery were at a very low
ebb. It certainly did not help matters much when,
towards night, Mary Quinn called Virginia&#8217;s attention
to the fact that there were unmistakable signs of a
bad rash on the faces of the twins, and very suspicious
spots on the cheeks of the Warren baby. Even the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
antiseptic James McCarthy blushed like a boiled lobster,
and went hopelessly back on his sterilized character.
Of course the only thing to be done was to
send at once for the doctor, and for the mothers of
the respective infants. When the doctor arrived he
pronounced the trouble to be measles; and when the
mothers made their appearance, Virginia learned
something of the unsuspected resources of the English
language served hot from the tongues of three
frightened and irate women. Finally the floor was
cleared, and the place closed up for disinfection.</p>
<p>Just before she left, Virginia dropped into a chair
and wept, quite oblivious of the well-meant consolations
of Mary Quinn, sometime co-partner in &#8220;The
Durford Day-Nursery for the Children of Working
Women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done the very best we could, Miss Bascom;
and it certainly isn&#8217;t our fault that the venture turned
out badly. Poor babies!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the sobbing Virginia was roused to one last
protest:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Quinn, if ever you say another word to me
about babies, I&#8217;ll have you arrested. I just hate
babies, and&mdash;and everything! Why, there comes Mr.
Maxwell! Say, Mary, you just run and get me a wet
towel to wipe my face with, while I hunt for my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
combs and do up my back hair. And then if you
wouldn&#8217;t mind vanishing for a while&mdash;I&#8217;m sure you
understand&mdash;for if ever I needed spiritual consolation
and the help of the church, it is now, this minute.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE RECTORY</h3>
</div>
<p>A few weeks after Donald&#8217;s conversational
duel with Mrs. Burke he started on a six-weeks&#8217;
vacation, which he had certainly
earned; and as he busied himself with his packing,&mdash;Hepsey
assisting,&mdash;he announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come back, Mrs. Burke, I probably shall
not come alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was strapping up his suit-case when he made
this rather startling announcement, and the effect
seemed to send the blood to his head. Mrs. Burke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
did not seem to notice his confusion as she remarked
calmly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! That&#8217;s a good thing. Your grandmother
can have the room next to yours, and we&#8217;ll do all we
can to make the old lady comfortable. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll
be a great comfort to you, though she&#8217;ll get a bit
lonesome at times, unless she&#8217;s active on her feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald laughed, as he blushed more furiously and
stuttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not going to bring my grandmother
here, and I strongly suspect that you know what I
mean. I&#8217;m going to be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are going to get married, are you?&#8221; Hepsey
remarked with due amazement, as if the suspicion
of the fact had never entered her head before.
&#8220;Well, I am mighty glad of it. I only wish that I
was goin&#8217; to be present to give you away. Yes, I&#8217;m
mighty glad. She&#8217;ll make a new man of you up here,
so long as she isn&#8217;t a new woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not in the slang sense of the word; although
I think you will find her very capable, and I hope
with all my heart that you&#8217;ll like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shall. The question is whether she&#8217;ll
like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey Burke looked rather sober for a moment,
and Donald instantly asserted:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t help liking you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell now, I could mention quite a number of
people who find it as easy as rolling off a log to <i>dis</i>like,
me. But that doesn&#8217;t matter much. I have found
it a pretty good plan not to expect a great deal of
adoration, and to be mighty grateful for the little
you get. Be sure you let me know when to expect
you and your grandmother back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly I shall,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;It will be
in about six weeks, you know. Good-by, and thank
you a thousand times for all your kindness to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was considerable moisture in Hepsey&#8217;s eyes
as she stood and watched Maxwell drive down the
road. Then wiping her eyes furtively with one corner
of her apron she remarked to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I am glad, mighty glad; but
somehow it isn&#8217;t the jolliest thing in the world to
have one&#8217;s friends get married. They are never the
same again; and in ten times out of six the lady in the
case is jealous of her husband&#8217;s friends, and tries to
make trouble. It takes a lady saint to share her
husband&#8217;s interests with anybody, and maybe she &#8217;aint
to blame. Well, the next thing in order is to fix up
the rectory in six weeks. The best way to repair that
thing is with a match and some real good kerosene
and a few shavings; however, we&#8217;ll have to do the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
best we can. I think I&#8217;ll set Jonathan Jackson to
work this afternoon, and go around and interview the
vestry myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan proved resignedly obedient to Hepsey&#8217;s
demands, but the vestry blustered and scolded, because
they had not been consulted in the matter, until
Hepsey said she would be glad to receive any contribution
they might choose to offer; then they relapsed
into innocuous desuetude and talked crops.</p>
<p>As soon as the repairs were well under way, the
whole town was wild with gossip about Maxwell and
Miss Bascom. If he were going to occupy the rectory,
the necessary inference was that he was going to be
married, as he surely would not contemplate keeping
bachelor&#8217;s hall by himself. At last Virginia had attained
the height of her ambition and captured the
rector! Consequently she was the center of interest
in every social gathering, although, as the engagement
had not been formally announced, no one felt at liberty
to congratulate her. To any tentative and insinuating
advances in this direction Virginia replied by
non-committal smiles, capable of almost any interpretation;
and the seeker after information was none the
wiser.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roscoe-Jones, by virtue of her long intimacy
with Hepsey and her assured social position in Durford&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
thirty gentry, felt that she was entitled to some
definite information; and so, as they walked back from
church one Wednesday afternoon, she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear that the parish is going to repair the rectory,
and that you are taking a great interest in it.
You must be on very intimate terms with Mr. Bascom
and the vestry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly. Bascom and I haven&#8217;t held
hands in the dark for some time; but I am going to
do what I can to get the house in order for Mr.
Maxwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where the money is coming from to complete
the work? It seems to me that the whole parish
ought to be informed about the matter, and share
in the work; but I suppose Mr. Bascom&#8217;s shouldering
it all, since there&#8217;s been no effort to raise money by
having a fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know much about it as yet, Sarah.
Of course Bascom&#8217;s charitable work is mostly done
in secret, so that nobody ever finds it out. He is a
modest man and wouldn&#8217;t like to be caught in the act
of signing a check for anybody else. It might seem
showy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand,&#8221; Mrs. Roscoe-Jones retorted
dryly; &#8220;but under the circumstances, that is&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Under what circumstances?&#8221; Mrs. Burke inquired
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, considering that Mr. Bascom is Virginia&#8217;s
father and would want to make her comfortable, you
know&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m awful stupid about some
things. You must have discovered that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Hepsey, what is the use of beating around
the bush like this? You must know the common gossip
of the town, and you must be in Mr. Maxwell&#8217;s
confidence. What shall I say when people ask me if
he is engaged to Virginia Bascom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell &#8217;em you don&#8217;t know a blessed thing about it.
What else can you tell &#8217;em? You might tell &#8217;em that
you tried to pump me and the pump wouldn&#8217;t work
&#8217;cause it needed packin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this, Mrs. Roscoe-Jones felt that there was
nothing left for her to do but retire from the scene;
so she crossed the road.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Burke began the actual work on the
rectory she quickly realized what she had to cope
with. The workmen of Durford had a pleasing habit
of accepting all offers of work, and promising anything,
and making a start so as to get the job; and
then, having upset the whole premises, they promptly
&#8220;lit out&#8221; for parts unknown in order to get another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
job, and no mortal knew when they would return. It
always seemed promising and hopeful to see a laboring
man arrive in his overalls with his dinner-pail and
tools at seven; but when two hours later he had vanished,
not to return, it was a bit discouraging. Mrs.
Burke was not in a very good humor when, arriving
at the rectory, she met Tom Snyder the plumber, at
ten-thirty, walking briskly away from his job. She
planted herself squarely across the walk and began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Thomas; where are you going, if
I may ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going back for my tools, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Thomas, but you were never more
mistaken in your life. You put the kitchen pipes out
of business two weeks ago, and you must have been
goin&#8217; back for your tools ever since. I suppose you&#8217;re
chargin&#8217; me by the hour for goin&#8217; backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas looked sheepish and scratched his head
with his dirty fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I have to finish a little job I begun for
Elias Warden on the hill. I&#8217;ll be back again right
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that, Thomas. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; back to the
rectory with me now, and if the job isn&#8217;t finished by
six o&#8217;clock, you&#8217;ll never get your hands on it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crestfallen Thomas reluctantly turned around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and accompanied Hepsey back to the rectory and finished
his work in half an hour.</p>
<p>After much trial and tribulation the rectory was
duly repaired, replastered, and papered. The grass
had been cut; the bushes were trimmed; and the house
had been painted. Then Mrs. Burke obtained a hayrack
with a team, and taking Nickey and Jonathan
Jackson with her, made a tour of the parish asking
for such furniture as individual parishioners were willing
to give. Late in the afternoon she arrived at the
rectory with a very large load, and the next day Jonathan
was made to set to work with his tools, and she
started in with some paint and varnish, and the result
seemed eminently satisfactory to her, even though
her hands were stained, she had had no dinner, and
her hair was stuck to her head here and there in shiny
spots. As they were leaving the house to return
home for supper, she scowled severely at Jonathan as
she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan, I do believe you&#8217;ve got more red paint
on the top of your head than you left on the kitchen
chairs. Do for mercy sake wash the end of your nose.
I don&#8217;t care to be seen comin&#8217; out of here with you
lookin&#8217; like that,&#8221; she added scathingly.</p>
<p>After that, it was, as Mrs. Burke remarked, just
fun to finish the rectory; and though so much had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
been given by the people of the parish, there were
many new pieces of furniture delivered, for which no
one could account. As neither Mr. Bascom nor Miss
Bascom had sent anything, and as neither had appeared
on the scene, excitement was at fever heat.
Rumor had it that Virginia had gone to the city for
a week or so, to buy her trousseau. Presently the report
circulated that Maxwell was going to bring his
bride back with him when he returned from his vacation.</p>
<p>The day before the one set for Maxwell&#8217;s arrival
Mrs. Burke confessed the truth, and suggested that
the rectory be stocked with provisions, so that the
bride and groom should have something to eat when
they first got home. The idea seemed to please the
parish, and provisions began to arrive and were placed
in the cellar, or on the newly painted pantry shelves,
or in the neat cupboards. Mrs. Talbot sent a bushel
of potatoes, Mrs. Peterson a pan of soda biscuit,
Mrs. Andrews two loaves of bread; Mrs. Squires donated
a pan of soda biscuit, Mrs. Johnson some frosted
cake, and Mrs. Marlow two bushels of apples.
Mrs. Hurd sent a pan of soda biscuit, Mrs. Waldorf
three dozen eggs, and a sack of flour; Mrs.
Freyburg sent a pan of soda biscuit, Mrs. Jones
a boiled ham, Mrs. Orchardson two bushels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
of turnips and half a pan of soda biscuit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke received the provisions as they arrived,
and put them where they belonged. Just about supper
time Mrs. Loomis came with a large bundle under
her arm and remarked to Hepsey:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d bring something nobody else would
think of&mdash;something out of the ordinary that perhaps
Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell would relish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that was real thoughtful of you, Mrs.
Loomis,&#8221; Hepsey replied. &#8220;What have you got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mrs. Loomis responded, &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d
bring &#8217;em two pans of my nice fresh soda biscuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke kept her face straight, and responded
cheerfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;That was awful nice of you, Mrs. Loomis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right. And if you want any more,
just let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, when the door was closed on the last contributor,
Mrs. Burke dropped into a chair and called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan Jackson, come here quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan responded promptly, and anxiously inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey, be you ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not sick; but we have ten pans of soda
biscuit. They are in the pantry, down cellar, in the
woodshed, on the parlor table. For mercy&#8217;s sake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
take eight pans out to the chickens or stick &#8217;em on
the picket fence. I just loathe soda biscuit; and if
any more come I shall throw &#8217;em at the head of the
woman that brings &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE BRIDE&#8217;S ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Next morning, when Nickey brought up the
mail, Mrs. Burke looked anxiously over her
letters until she came to the one she was expecting.
She read it in silence.</p>
<p>The gist of the matter was that Maxwell had been
married to the nicest girl in the world, and was looking
forward to having Mrs. Burke meet her, and to
have his wife know the woman who had been so supremely
good to him in the parish. He closed by informing
her that they were to return the next day at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
five P. M., and if it were not asking too much, he
hoped that she would take them in for a few days
until they could find quarters elsewhere. The letter
was countersigned by a pretty little plea for friendship
from &#8220;Mrs. Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke replaced the letter and murmured to
herself, smiling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little dear! Of course they could come and
stay as long as they pleased; but as the rectory is in
order, I think that I&#8217;ll meet them at the depot, and
take them there direct. They&#8217;ll be much happier alone
by themselves from the start. I&#8217;ll have supper ready
for &#8217;em, and cook the chickens while they&#8217;re unpackin&#8217;
their trunks.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Burke thought it best to maintain a discreet
silence as to the time of their arrival, there was
no one but herself to meet them at the station when
the train pulled in. As Maxwell presented his wife
to Mrs. Burke, Hepsey took the girl&#8217;s two hands in
hers and kissed her heartily, and then, looking at her
keenly as the bride blushed under her searching gaze,
she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a dreadful disappointment, Mrs. Maxwell.
I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;ll take me a long time to get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am horribly sorry to disappoint you so, Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>Maxwell laughed, while Mrs. Betty looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Burke continued, &#8220;you&#8217;re a dreadful
disappointment. Your picture isn&#8217;t half as sweet as
you are.&#8221; Then turning to Maxwell, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me? Who taught you to
pick out just the right sort of wife, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>She</i> did!&#8221; Maxwell replied, pointing delightedly
to the young woman, who was still smiling and blushing
under Hepsey&#8217;s inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Burke,&#8221; Mrs. Betty interposed, &#8220;can&#8217;t
you give me a little credit for &#8216;picking out&#8217; Donald,
as you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Mr. Maxwell&#8217;s pretty fine, though I wouldn&#8217;t
want to have you tell him so, for anything. But I
know, because Durford is calculated to test a man&#8217;s
mettle, if any place ever was. Now Mrs. Betty, if
that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m to call you, if you&#8217;ll get into the
wagon we&#8217;ll drive home and have some supper. You
must be &#8217;most famished by this time, if you stop
thinkin&#8217; about Mr. Maxwell long enough to have an
appetite. I suppose that we might have had a committee
of the vestry down here to bid you welcome to
Durford; and Nickey suggested the village band and
some hot air balloons, and that the boys of the parish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
should pull the carriage up to the house after they&#8217;d
presented you with a magnificent bouquet; but I
thought you&#8217;d just like to slip in unnoticed and get
acquainted with your parishioners one at a time. It&#8217;d
be simply awful to have a whole bunch of &#8217;em thrown
at your head at once; and as for the whole vestry&mdash;well,
never mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>They got into the &#8220;democrat&#8221; and started out at a
smart trot, but when they came to the road which
turned toward Thunder Cliff, Mrs. Burke drove
straight across the green.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where are you going, Mrs. Burke?&#8221; Maxwell
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought that maybe Mrs. Betty would like
to get a sight of the town before we went home.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they came to the rectory and turned into the
yard, the wonderful transformation dawned on Maxwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious, what a change! It&#8217;s perfectly marvelous,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;Why Mrs. Burke, I believe
you&#8217;ve brought us here to live!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, my friend. This is where you belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly do beat the Dutch. Who is
responsible for all this, I&#8217;d like to know? But of
course it&#8217;s you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had a hand in it, but so did the whole
parish. Now walk right in and make yourselves at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke enjoyed to the full Maxwell&#8217;s surprise
and delight, as he and Mrs. Betty explored the house
like a couple of very enthusiastic children. When
they got into the china closet and Mrs. Betty found
a silver tea-ball she exclaimed rapturously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Donald! Did you ever see the like of
this? Here is a regular tea-ball. We will have tea
every afternoon at four, and Mrs. Burke will be our
guest. How perfectly delightful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This remark seemed to please Hepsey mightily, as
she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my, no! Do you want to spoil my nervous
system? We are not given much to tea-balls in Durford.
We consider ourselves lucky if we get a plain
old-fashioned pot. Now you get fixed up,&#8221; she directed,
&#8220;while I get supper ready, and I&#8217;ll stay just
this time, if you&#8217;ll let me, and then if you can stand
it, perhaps you&#8217;ll ask me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they sat down to a little table covered with
spotless linen and a pretty set of white china with
gold bands. Maxwell did not say much; he was still
too surprised and delighted.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 538px;'>
&#8220;OH WELL, I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT TWO YOUNG MARRIED PEOPLE SHOULD START OUT BY THEMSELVES, AND THEN IF THEY GET INTO A FAMILY ROW IT WON&#8217;T SCANDALIZE THE PARISH&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>The broiled chickens and the browned potato balls
were placed before Maxwell, who faced Mrs. Betty&mdash;Hepsey
sitting between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this is what I call rich,&#8221; Maxwell exclaimed
as he carved. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the slightest suspicion that
we were to come here and find all these luxuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However did the house get furnished?&#8221; chimed in
Mrs. Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; Mrs. Burke replied, &#8220;I always believe
that two young married people should start out by
themselves, you know; and then if they get into a
family row it won&#8217;t scandalize the parish. The only
new thing about the furnishings is paint and varnish.
I drove around and held up the parish, and made
them stand and deliver the goods, and Jonathan Jackson
and I touched it up a little; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to acknowledge each gift personally,&#8221;
Maxwell said. &#8220;You must tell us who&#8217;s given what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no you won&#8217;t. When I took these things away
from their owners by force, I acknowledged them in
the politest way possible, so as to save you the
trouble. You&#8217;re not supposed to know where a thing
came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there must have been a lot of money spent on
the rectory to get it into shape,&#8221; Maxwell asserted.
&#8220;Where did it all come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke grinned with amusement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, can&#8217;t you guess? Of course it was that
merry-hearted, generous old Senior Warden of yours.
Who else could it be? If there is anything you need,
just let us know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the house seems to be very completely furnished
as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not yet. If you look around you&#8217;ll see lots
of things that aren&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Betty quite raved over the salad, made of
lettuce, oranges, walnuts and a mayonnaise dressing.
Then there came ice cream and chocolate sauce, followed
by black coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is quite too much, Mrs. Burke. You must
be a superb cook. I am horribly afraid you&#8217;ll have
spoiled Donald, so that my cooking will seem very
tame to him,&#8221; Mrs. Betty remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, Mrs. Betty. If worst comes
to worst there are seven pans of soda biscuit secreted
around the premises somewhere; so don&#8217;t be discouraged.
There are lots of things you can do with a
soda biscuit, if you know how. Now we&#8217;ll just clear
the table, and wash the dishes, and put things away.&#8221;</p>
<p>When about nine o&#8217;clock she arose to go, Maxwell
took both Hepsey&#8217;s hands in his and said quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, I&#8217;m more indebted to you than I can
possibly say, for all you have done for us. I wish I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
knew how to thank you properly, but I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that,&#8221; Mrs. Burke replied, a mist
gathering in her eyes, &#8220;it&#8217;s been lots of fun, and if
you&#8217;re satisfied I&#8217;m more than pleased.&#8221; Then, putting
her arm around Mrs. Betty&#8217;s waist, she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that we&#8217;re not payin&#8217; this nice little
wife of yours to do parish work, and if people interfere
with her you just tell em to go to Thunder Cliff.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was turning away when suddenly she stopped,
an expression of horror on her face:</p>
<p>&#8220;My! think of that now! This was a bride&#8217;s dinner-party,
and I put yellow flowers on the table, instead
of white! What&#8217;d city folks say to that!&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XI_VIRGINIAS_HIGH_HORSE' id='CHAPTER_XI_VIRGINIAS_HIGH_HORSE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>VIRGINIA&#8217;S HIGH HORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Betty soon succeeded in winning a
place for herself in the hearts of her parishioners,
and those who called to look over
her &#8220;clothes,&#8221; and see if she was going to &#8220;put on
airs&#8221; as a city woman, called again because they really
liked her. She returned the calls with equal interest,
and soon had her part of the parish organization well
in hand.</p>
<p>Maxwell&#8217;s choice was, in fact, heartily approved&mdash;except
by Virginia Bascom and the Senior Warden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
The former took the opportunity to leave cards on
an afternoon when all Durford was busily welcoming
Betty at a tea; and was &#8220;not at home&#8221; when Betty
duly returned the call. Virginia was also careful not
to &#8220;see&#8221; either Betty or her husband if, by any
chance, they passed her when in town.</p>
<p>Of all of which man&oelig;uvres Betty and Donald remained
apparently sublimely unconscious.</p>
<p>As a means of making some return for the good-hearted
generosity and hospitality of the inhabitants,
represented by the furniture at the rectory and many
tea-parties under various roof-trees, Mrs. Maxwell
persuaded her husband that they should give a parish
party.</p>
<p>So invitations were issued broadcast, and Mrs.
Burke was asked to scan the lists, lest anyone be
omitted. China sufficient for the occasion was supplemented
by Hepsey Burke and Jonathan Jackson,
and Nickey laid his invaluable services under contribution
to fetch and carry&mdash;organizing a corps of
helpers.</p>
<p>The whole adult village,&mdash;at least the feminine
portion of it,&mdash;young and old, presented themselves
at the party, dressed in their best bibs and tuckers,
amusing themselves outdoors at various improvised
games, under the genial generalship of their host;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and regaling themselves within at the tea-tables presided
over by Mrs. Betty, whose pride it was to have
prepared with her own hands,&mdash;assisted by the indefatigable
Hepsey,&mdash;all the cakes and preserves and
other confections provided for the occasion. The
whole party was one whole-hearted, simply convivial
gathering&mdash;with but a single note to mar it; and who
knows whether the rector, and still less the rector&#8217;s
wife, would have noticed it, but for Hepsey Burke&#8217;s
subsequent &#8220;boiling over?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the games and feast were at full swing, Virginia
Bascom&#8217;s loud-voiced automobile drove up, and
the door-bell pealed. The guests ceased chattering
and the little maid, hired for the occasion, hurried
from the tea-cups to answer the haughty summons.
Through the silence in the tea-room, produced by the
overpowering clatter of the bell, the voice of the little
maid,&mdash;quite too familiar for the proper formality
of the occasion, in Virginia&#8217;s opinion,&mdash;was heard
to pipe out cheerily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in, Miss Virginia; the folks has eat
most all the victuals&mdash;but I guess Mrs. Maxwell&#8217;ll
find ye some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please announce &#8216;Miss Virginia Bascom&#8217;,&#8221; droned
the lady, ignoring the untoward levity of the now
cowering maid, and followed her to the door of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
room full of guests, where she paused impressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bascom,&#8221; called the confused maid, through
the solemn silence, as all eyes turned towards the
door, &#8220;here&#8217;s,&mdash;this is,&mdash;I mean Miss Virginia says
Miss Virginia Maxwell&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; After which confusing
and somewhat embarrassing announcement the maid
summarily fled to the kitchen, and left Virginia to
her own devices.</p>
<p>Betty at once came forward, and quite ignoring the
error, smiled a pleasant welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Bascom, it is very nice to know you at last.
We have been so unlucky, have we not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia advanced rustling, and gave Betty a frigid
finger-tip, held shoulder-high, and cast a collective
stare at hostess and guests through her lorgnette,
bowing to Maxwell and ignoring his proffered handshake.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause. For once even
Betty-the-self-possessed was at a loss for the necessary
tactics.</p>
<p>A hearty voice soon filled the empty spaces: &#8220;Hello
there, Ginty; I always did say those auto&#8217;s was a
poor imitation of a street-car; when they get balky
and leave you sticking in the road-side and make you
behind-time, you can&#8217;t so much as get your fare back
and walk. None but royalty, duchesses, and the four-hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
can afford to risk losing their cup o&#8217; tea in
them things.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at Hepsey&#8217;s sally, and
conversation again resumed its busy buzzing, and
Virginia was obliged to realize that her entry had been
something of a frost.</p>
<p>She spent some minutes drawing off her gloves,
sipped twice at a cup of tea, and nibbled once at a
cake; spent several more minutes getting her hands
back into her gloves, fixed a good-by smile on her
face, murmured some unintelligible words to her
hostess, and departed, annoyed to realize that the
engine of the awaiting car&mdash;kept running to emphasize
her comet-like passage through so mixed an assembly&mdash;had
become quite inaudible to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such an insult!&#8221; stormed the lady, as she returned
home in high dudgeon. &#8220;I might have been a nobody,
the way they treated me. Dad shall hear of this;
and I&#8217;ll see that he puts them where they belong. The
impudence! And after his t-treating me s-s-so!&#8221; she
wept with chagrin, and malice that betokened no good
to the rector and his little wife.</p>
<p>Even so, it is doubtful if the host and hostess would
have permitted themselves to notice the supercilious
rudeness of the leader of Durford &#8220;Society,&#8221; had
Hepsey been able to curb her indignation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>As she and Betty and the little maid, assisted by
Donald and Nickey and his helpers, were clearing
up the fragments that remained of the entertainment,
Hepsey broke forth:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t set that young woman down in her place
where she belongs before I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve missed my
guess: &#8216;Please announce Miss Virginia Bascom,&#8217; indeed!
If that isn&#8217;t sauce, I&#8217;m the goose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh never mind, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; soothed Betty in a
low voice; &#8220;she&#8217;ll soon realize that we&#8217;re doing things
in good old country style, and haven&#8217;t brought any
city ways with us to Durford. I dare say she
thought&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought nothin&#8217;!&#8221; replied the exasperated Hepsey.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll thought her, with her high looks and her
proud stomach, as the psalmist says. I&#8217;d like&mdash;oh,
wouldn&#8217;t I just like to send up a nice little basket of
these left-over victuals to Ginty, &#8216;with Mrs. Maxwell&#8217;s
regards.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed heartily, but Betty was determined
not to let herself dwell on anything so trivial, and
soon, by way of changing the subject, she was putting
Nickey up to the idea of forming a boy-scout corps,
which, as she added, could present the village with
a thoroughly versatile organization, both useful and
ornamental.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; remarked Nickey, who quickly saw himself
captaining a body of likely young blades, &#8220;that&#8217;d be
some lively corpse, believe me. When can we start
in, Mrs. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must ask Mr. Maxwell all about that, Nickey,&#8221;
she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not now,&#8221; interposed his mother. &#8220;You come
along with me this minute, and let Mr. Maxwell have
a bit of peace; I know how he just loves these teas.
Good night, all!&#8221; she called as she departed with her
son under her wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald! Wasn&#8217;t it all fun&mdash;and weren&#8217;t they all
splendid?&#8221; Betty glowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;More fun than a barrel of Bascoms&mdash;monkeys, I
mean,&#8221; he corrected himself, laughing at Betty&#8217;s
shocked expression.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>HOUSE CLEANING AND BACHELORHOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>Apart from Mrs. Burke, there was no one in
the town who so completely surrendered to
Mrs. Maxwell&#8217;s charms as Jonathan Jackson,
the Junior Warden. Betty had penetration
enough to see, beneath the man&#8217;s rough exterior, all
that was fine and lovable, and she treated him with a
jolly, friendly manner that warmed his heart.</p>
<p>One day she and Mrs. Burke went over to call on
Jonathan, and found him sitting in the woodshed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
a tub turned bottom upwards, looking very forlorn
and disconsolate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Jonathan? You look as if
you had committed the unpardonable sin,&#8221; Hepsey
greeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it &#8217;aint me,&#8221; Jonathan replied; &#8220;it&#8217;s Mary
McGuire that&#8217;s the confounded sinner this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s Mary been up to now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary McGuire&#8217;s got one of her attacks of house-cleanin&#8217;
on, and I tell you it&#8217;s a bad one. Drat the
nuisance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Jonathan! Don&#8217;t swear like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I be hanged if I can stand this sort of thing
much longer. Mary, she&#8217;s the deuce and all, when
she once gets started house-cleanin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; Mrs. Betty sympathized. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bother,
isnt it? But it doesn&#8217;t take so long, and it will
soon be over, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as to that,&#8221; replied Jonathan
disconsolately. &#8220;Mary McGuire seems to think that
the whole house must be turned wrong side out, and
every bit of furniture I&#8217;ve got deposited in the front
yard. Now, Mrs. Betty, you just look over there
once. There&#8217;s yards and yards of clothes-line covered
with carpets and rugs and curtains I&#8217;ve been ordered
to clean. It&#8217;s somethin&#8217; beyond words. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
whole place looks as if there was goin&#8217; to be an auction,
or a rummage sale, or as if we had moved out
&#8217;cause the house was afire. Then she falls to with
tubs of boilin&#8217; hot soap-suds, until it fills your lungs,
and drips off the ends of your nose and your fingers,
and smells like goodness knows what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan!&#8221; Hepsey reproved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you exaggerating just the least bit?&#8221; echoed
Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m not. Words can&#8217;t begin to tell
the tale when Mary gets the fever on. I thought I
noticed symptoms of house-cleanin&#8217; last week. Mary
was eyein&#8217; things round the house, and givin&#8217; me less
and less to eat, and lookin&#8217; at me with that cold-storage
stare of hers that means death or house-cleanin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Jackson,&#8221; Betty pleaded, &#8220;your house
has to be cleaned sometimes, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Jonathan replied. &#8220;But there&#8217;s altogether
too much of this house-cleanin&#8217; business goin&#8217;
on to suit me. I don&#8217;t see any dirt anywheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are a man,&#8221; Hepsey retorted.
&#8220;Men never see dirt until they have to take a shovel
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan sighed hopelessly. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of
bein&#8217; a widower,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you can&#8217;t even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
have your own way in your own house, I&#8217;d just like to
know? I have to eat odds and ends of cold victuals
out here in the woodshed, or anywhere Mary McGuire
happens to drop &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s tough luck, Mr. Jackson. You just come
over to dinner with Donald and me and have a square
meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to awful well, Mrs. Maxwell, but I
dasn&#8217;t: if I didn&#8217;t camp out and eat her cold victuals
she&#8217;d laid out for me, it&#8217;d spoil the pleasure of house-cleanin&#8217;
for her. &#8217;Taint as though it was done with
when she&#8217;s finished, neither. After it&#8217;s all over, and
things are set to rights, they&#8217;re all wrong. Some
shades won&#8217;t roll up. Some won&#8217;t roll down; why,
I&#8217;ve undressed in the dark before now, since one of
&#8217;em suddenly started rollin&#8217; up on me before I&#8217;d got
into bed, and scared the wits out of me. She&#8217;ll be
askin&#8217; me to let her give the furnace a sponge bath
next. I believe she&#8217;d use tooth-powder on the inside
of a boiled egg, if she only knew how. This house-cleanin&#8217;
racket is all dum nonsense, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Jonathan! Don&#8217;t swear like that,&#8221; Betty
exclaimed laughing; &#8220;Mr. Maxwell&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said <i>d-u-m</i>, Mrs. Betty; I never say nothin&#8217;
worse than that&mdash;&#8217;cept when I lose my temper,&#8221; he
added, safely, examining first the hone and then the
edge of the scythe, as if intending to sharpen it.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;I AIN&#8217;T A CHICKEN NO MORE, MRS. BETTY, AND I&#8217;VE &#8217;MOST FORGOT HOW TO DO A BIT OF COURTIN&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>Hepsey had gone into the house to inspect for herself
the thoroughness of Mary McGuire&#8217;s operations;
Betty thought the opportunity favorable for
certain counsels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with you is you shouldn&#8217;t be living
alone, like this, Jonathan. You have all the disadvantages
of a house, and none of the pleasures of a
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he responded, yawning, &#8220;it&#8217;s true enough;
but I &#8217;aint a chicken no more, Mrs. Betty, and I&#8217;ve
&#8217;most forgot how to do a bit of courtin&#8217;. What with
cleanin&#8217; up, and puttin&#8217; on your Sunday clothes, and
goin&#8217; to the barber&#8217;s, and gettin&#8217; a good ready, it&#8217;s a
considerable effort for an old man like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t want to see your clothes; they want
to see you. If you feel obliged to, you can send your
Sunday clothes around some day and let her look at
them once for all. Keeping young is largely a matter
of looking after your digestion and getting plenty of
sleep. Its all foolishness for you to talk about growing
old. Why, you are in the prime of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Yes. And why don&#8217;t you tell me that I
look real handsome, and that the girls are all crazy
for me. You&#8217;re an awful jollier, Mrs. Betty, though
I&#8217;ll admit that a little jollyin&#8217; does me a powerful lot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
of good now and then. I sometimes like to believe
things I know to a certainty &#8217;aint true, if they make
me feel good.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Betty kept silent, gazing into the
kindly face, and then the instinct of match-making
asserted itself too strongly to be resisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no sense in your being a lonesome widower.
Why don&#8217;t you get married? I mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Jonathan was too astounded at the
audacity of the serious suggestion to reply; but when
he recovered his breath he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I swan to man! What will you ask me to
be doin&#8217; next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean it, all right,&#8221; persisted Mrs. Betty.
&#8220;Here you&#8217;ve got a nice home for a wife, and I tell
you you need the happiness of a real home. You will
live a whole lot longer if you have somebody to love
and look after; and if you want to know what you
will be asking me to do next, I will wager a box of
candy it will be to come to your wedding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it cigars, Mrs. Betty; I&#8217;m not much on
candy. Maybe you&#8217;re up to tellin&#8217; me who&#8217;ll have
me. I haven&#8217;t noticed any females makin&#8217; advances
towards me in some time now. The only woman I
see every day is Mary McGuire, and she&#8217;d make a
pan-cake griddle have the blues if she looked at it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Betty grasped her elbow with one hand, and
putting the first finger of the other hand along the
side of her little nose, whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Mrs. Burke?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan deliberately pulled a hair from his small
remaining crop and cut it with the scythe, as if he
had not heard Betty&#8217;s impertinent suggestion. But
finally he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; the matter with Mrs. Burke that
I know of; but that&#8217;s no reason why she should be
wantin&#8217; to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks a great deal of you; I know she does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she does?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I heard her say something very nice about
you yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Did you? What was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said that you were the most&mdash;the most economical
man she ever met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she didn&#8217;t say I was tighter than the bark on
a tree? I guess I &#8217;aint buyin&#8217; no weddin&#8217; ring on the
strength of that. Now, Mrs. Betty, you just try
again. I guess you&#8217;re fooling me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, really I&#8217;m not. I never was more serious
in my life. I mean just what I say. I know Mrs.
Burke really thinks a very great deal of you, and if
you like her, you ought to propose to her. Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
moment a man remains single is an outrageous waste
of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan grinned as he retorted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no man would waste any time if all the girls
were like you. They&#8217;d all be comin&#8217; early to avoid
the rush. Is Mrs. Burke employin&#8217; your services as
a matrimonial agent? Maybe you won&#8217;t mind tellin&#8217;
me what you&#8217;re to get if the deal pulls off. Is there
a rake-off anywheres?&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty laughed, and Jonathan was silent for a while,
squinting at the scythe-edge, first from one angle,
then from another, and tentatively raising the hone
as if to start sharpening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Betty,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;seein&#8217; I
can&#8217;t possibly marry you, I don&#8217;t mind tellin&#8217; you that
I think the next best thing would be to marry Hepsey
Burke. She&#8217;s been a mighty good friend and neighbor
ever since my wife died; but she wouldn&#8217;t look
at the likes of me. &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be the least use of
proposin&#8217; to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know it wouldn&#8217;t? You are not
afraid of proposing, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not; but I can&#8217;t run over and propose,
as I would ask her to lend me some clothes-line.
That&#8217;d be too sudden; and courtin&#8217; takes a lot
of time and trouble. I guess I &#8217;most forgot how by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
this time; and then, to tell you the truth, I always was
a bit shy. It took me near onto five years to work
myself up to the sticking point when I proposed to my
first wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now that&#8217;s easy enough; Mrs. Burke usually
sits on the side porch after supper with her knitting.
Why don&#8217;t you drop over occasionally, and approach
the matter gradually? It wouldn&#8217;t take long
to work up to the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how shall I begin? I guess you&#8217;ll have to
give me lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, make her think you are very lonely. Pity is
akin to love, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she knows well enough I&#8217;m mighty lonely at
times. That won&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then make her think that you are a regular daredevil,
and are going to the bad. Maybe she&#8217;ll marry
you to save you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, goin&#8217; to the bad at my age, and the Junior
Warden of the church, too. What are you thinkin&#8217;
of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is never too late to mend, you know. You
might try being a little frisky, and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what would happen all right. She&#8217;d
be over here in two jerks of a lamb&#8217;s tail, and read
the riot act, and scare me out of a year&#8217;s growth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Hepsey&#8217;s not a little thing to be playin&#8217; with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you just make a start. Anything to make
a start, and the rest will come easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, how the neighbors&#8217;d talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk is cheap; and besides, in a quiet place like
this it&#8217;s a positive duty to afford your neighbors some
diversion; you ought to be thankful. You&#8217;ll become
a public benefactor. Now will you go ahead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Betty, worry&#8217;s bad for the nerves, and&#8217;s apt
to produce insomny and neurastheny. But I&#8217;ll think
it over&mdash;yes, I will&mdash;I&#8217;ll think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon he suddenly began to whet his scythe
with such vim as positively startled Betty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE CIRCUS</h3>
</div>
<p>The Maxwells were, in fact, effectively stirring
up the ambitions of their flock, routing the
older members out of a too easy-going acceptance
of things-as-they-are, and giving to the younger
ones vistas of a life imbued with more color and
variety than had hitherto entered their consciousness.
And yet it happened at Durford, on occasion, that
this awakening of new talents and individuality produced
unlocked for complications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; Hepsey remarked one day to Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Betty, when the subject of conversation had turned to
Mrs. Burke&#8217;s son and heir, &#8220;Nickey means to be a
good boy, but he&#8217;s as restless as a kitten on a hot
Johnny-cake. He isn&#8217;t a bit vicious, but he do run
his heels down at the corners, and he&#8217;s awful wearin&#8217;
on his pants-bottoms and keeps me patchin&#8217; and mendin&#8217;
most of the time&mdash;&#8216;contributing to the end in view,&#8217;
as Abraham Lincoln said. But, woman-like, I guess
he finds the warmest spot in my heart when I&#8217;m doin&#8217;
some sort of repairin&#8217; on him or his clothes. It would
be easier if his intentions wasn&#8217;t so good, &#8217;cause I
could spank him with a clear conscience if he was
vicious. But after all, Nickey seems to have a winnin&#8217;
way about him. He knows every farmer within three
miles; he&#8217;ll stop any team he meets, climb into the
wagon seat, take the reins, and enjoy himself to his
heart&#8217;s content. All the men seem to like him and
give in to him; more&#8217;s the pity! And he seems to
just naturally lead the other kids in their games and
mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well, I wouldn&#8217;t give a cent for a boy who
didn&#8217;t get into mischief sometimes,&#8221; consoled Mrs.
Betty.</p>
<p>At which valuation Nickey was then in process of
putting himself and his young friends at a premium.
For, about this time, in their efforts to amuse themselves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Nickey and some of his friends constructed a
circus ring back of the barn: After organizing a
stock company and conducting several rehearsals, the
rest of the boys in the neighborhood were invited to
form an audience, and take seats which had been reserved
for them without extra charge on an adjoining
lumber pile. Besides the regular artists there were a
number of specialists or &#8220;freaks,&#8221; who added much
to the interest and excitement of the show.</p>
<p>For example, Sam Cooley, attired in one of Mrs.
Burke&#8217;s discarded underskirts, filched from the ragbag,
with some dried cornstalk gummed on his face,
impersonated the famous Bearded Lady from Hoboken.</p>
<p>Billy Burns, wearing a very hot and stuffy pillow
buttoned under his coat and thrust down into his
trousers, represented the world-renowned Fat Man
from Spoonville. His was rather a difficult role to
fill gracefully, because the squashy pillow would persist
in bulging out between his trousers and his coat
in a most indecent manner; and it kept him busy most
of the time tucking it in.</p>
<p>Dimple Perkins took the part of the Snake Charmer
from Brooklyn, and at intervals wrestled fearlessly
with a short piece of garden hose which was labeled
on the bills as an &#8220;Anna Condy.&#8221; This he wound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
around his neck in the most reckless manner possible;
it was quite enough to make one&#8217;s blood run cold to
watch him.</p>
<p>The King of the Cannibal Islands was draped in
a buffalo robe, with a gilt paper crown adorning his
head, and a very suggestive mutton-bone in his hand.</p>
<p>Poor little Herman Amdursky was selected for the
Living Skeleton, because of the spindle-like character
of his nethermost limbs. He had to remove his
trousers and his coat, and submit to having his ribs
wound with yards of torn sheeting, in order that what
little flesh he had might be compressed to the smallest
possible compass. The result was astonishingly
satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Wild Man from Borneo wore his clothes wrong
side out, as it is well known wild men from Borneo
always do; and he ate grass with avidity. Wry-mouthed
and squint-eyed, he was the incarnation of
the cubist ideal.</p>
<p>When all this splendid array of talent issued from
the dressing-room and marched triumphantly around
the ring, it was indeed a proud moment in the annals
of Durford, and the applause from the lumber pile
could be heard at least two blocks.</p>
<p>After the procession, the entertainment proper consisted
of some high and lofty tumbling, the various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
&#8220;turns&#8221; of the respective stars, and then, last of all,
as a grand finale, Charley, the old raw-boned farm
horse who had been retired on a pension for at least
a year, was led triumphantly into the ring, with Nickey
Burke standing on his back!</p>
<p>Charley, whose melancholy aspect was a trifle more
abject than usual, and steps more halting, meekly followed
the procession of actors around the ring, led
by Dimple, the Snake Charmer. Nickey&#8217;s entree created
a most profound sensation, and was greeted with
tumultuous applause&mdash;a tribute both to his equestrian
feat and to his costume.</p>
<p>Nickey had once attended a circus at which he had
been greatly impressed by the artistic decorations on
the skin of a tattooed man, and by the skill of the
bareback rider who had turned somersaults while the
horse was in motion. It occurred to him that perhaps
he might present somewhat of both these attractions,
in one character.</p>
<p>Maxwell had innocently stimulated this taste by
lending him a book illustrated with lurid color-plates
of Indians in full war paint, according to tribe.</p>
<p>So Nickey removed his clothes, attired himself in
abbreviated red swimming trunks, and submitted to
the artistic efforts of Dimple, who painted most intricate,
elaborate, and beautiful designs on Nickey&#8217;s person,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
with a thick solution of indigo purloined from
the laundry.</p>
<p>Nickey&#8217;s breast was adorned with a picture of a
ship under full sail. On his back was a large heart
pierced with two arrows. A vine of full blown roses
twined around each arm, while his legs were powdered
with stars, periods, dashes, and exclamation points in
rich profusion. A triangle was painted on each cheek,
and dabs of indigo were added to the end of his nose
and to the lobe of each ear by way of finishing touches.</p>
<p>When the work was complete, Nickey surveyed
himself in a piece of broken mirror in the dressing-room,
and to tell the truth, was somewhat appalled
at his appearance; but Dimple Perkins hastened to
assure him, saying that a dip in the river would easily
remove the indigo; and that he was the living spit and
image of a tattooed man, and that his appearance,
posed on the back of Charley, would certainly bring
the house down.</p>
<p>Dimple proved to be quite justified in his statement,
so far as the effect on the audience was concerned;
for, as Nickey entered the ring, after one moment of
breathless astonishment, the entire crowd arose as
one man and cheered itself hoarse, in a frenzy of
frantic delight. Now whether Charley was enthused
by the applause, or whether the situation reminded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
him of some festive horseplay of his youth, one cannot
tell. At any rate, what little life was left in Charley&#8217;s
blood asserted itself. Quickly jerking the rope
of the halter from the astonished hand of Dimple
Perkins, Charley turned briskly round, and trotted
out of the yard and into the road, while Nickey, who
had found himself suddenly astride Charley&#8217;s back,
made frantic efforts to stop him.</p>
<p>As Charley emerged from the gate, the freaks, the
regular artists, the gymnasts, and the entire audience
followed, trailing along behind the mounted tattooed
man, and shouting themselves hoarse with encouragement
or derision.</p>
<p>As Charley rose to the occasion and quickened his
pace, the heat of the sun, the violent exercise of riding
bareback, and the nervous excitement produced by
the horror of the situation, threw Nickey into a profuse
sweat. The bluing began to run. The decorations
on his forehead trickled down into his eyes; and
as he tried to rub off the moisture with the back of
his hand the indigo was smeared liberally over his
face. His personal identity was hopelessly obscured
in the indigo smudge; and the most vivid imagination
could not conjecture what had happened to the boy.
It was by no means an easy feat to retain his seat on
Charley&#8217;s back; it would have been still more difficult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
to dismount, at his steed&#8217;s brisk pace; and Nickey
was most painfully conscious of his attire, as Charley
turned up the road which led straight to the village.
At each corner the procession was reinforced by a
number of village boys who added their quota to the
general uproar and varied the monotony of the proceeding
by occasionally throwing a tin can at the rider
on the white horse. When Charley passed the rectory,
and the green, and turned into Church Street,
Nickey felt that he had struck rock bottom of shameful
humiliation.</p>
<p>For many years it had been Charley&#8217;s habit to take
Mrs. Burke down to church on Wednesday afternoons
for the five o&#8217;clock service; and although he
had been out of commission and docked for repairs
for some time, his subliminal self must have got in its
work, and the old habit asserted itself: to the church
he went, attended at a respectful distance by the
Bearded Lady, the Fat Man, the Snake Charmer, the
King of the Cannibal Islands, the Living Skeleton,
and the Wild Man from Borneo, to say nothing of a
large and effective chorus of roaring villagers bringing
up the rear.</p>
<p>It really was quite clever of Charley to recall that,
this being Wednesday, it was the proper day to visit
the church,&mdash;as clever as it was disturbing to Nickey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
when he, too, recalled that it was about time for the
service to be over, and that his mother must be somewhere
on the premises, to say nothing of the assembled
mothers of the entire stock company&mdash;and the
rector, and the rector&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke, poor woman, was quite unconscious of
what awaited her, as she emerged from the service
with the rest of the congregation. It was an amazed
parent that caught sight of her son and heir scrambling
off the back of his steed onto the horse-block in
front of the church, clad in short swimming trunks
and much bluing. The freaks, the regular artists,
the gymnasts, and the circus audience generally
shrieked and howled and fought each other, in frantic
effort to succeed to Nickey&#8217;s place on Charley&#8217;s back&mdash;for
Charley now stood undismayed and immovable,
with a gentle, pious look in his soft old eyes.</p>
<p>For one instant, Mrs. Burke and her friends stood
paralyzed with horror; and then like the good mothers
in Israel that they were, each jumped to the rescue
of her own particular darling&mdash;that is, as soon as
she could identify him. Consternation reigned supreme.
Mrs. Cooley caught the Bearded Lady by
the arm and shook him fiercely, just as he was about
to land an uppercut on the jaw of the King of the
Cannibal Islands. Mrs. Burns found her offspring,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the Fat Man, lying dispossessed on his back in the
gutter, while Sime Wilkins, the Man Who Ate Glass,
sat comfortably on his stomach. Sime immediately
apologized to Mrs. Burns and disappeared. Next,
Mrs. Perkins took the Snake Charmer by his collar,
and rapped him soundly with the piece of garden hose
which she captured as he was using it to chastise the
predatory Wild Man from Borneo. Other members
of the company received equally unlooked-for censure
of their dramatic efforts.</p>
<p>Nickey, meantime, had fled to the pump behind the
church, where he made his ablutions as best he could;
then, seeing the vestry room door ajar, he, in his extremity,
bolted for the quiet seclusion of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>To his surprise and horror, he found Maxwell seated
at a table looking over the parish records; and
when Nickey appeared, still rather blue, attired in
short red trunks, otherwise unadorned, Donald gazed
at him in mute astonishment. For one moment there
was silence as they eyed each other; and then Maxwell
burst into roars of uncontrollable laughter, which
were not quite subdued as Nickey gave a rather incoherent
account of the misfortune which had brought
him to such a predicament.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you were the Tattooed Man, were you! Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
I suppose you know that it&#8217;s not generally customary
to appear in church in red tights; but as you couldn&#8217;t
help it, I shall have to see what can be done for you,
to get you home clothed and in your right mind. I&#8217;ll
tell you! You can put on one of the choir boy&#8217;s
cassocks, and skip home the back way. If anybody
stops you tell them you were practising for the choir,
and it will be all right. But really, Nickey, if I were
in your place, the next time I posed as a mounted
Tattooed Man, I&#8217;d be careful to choose some old
quadruped that couldn&#8217;t run away with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you aren&#8217;t mad at me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I&#8217;ll leave that to my betters! You
just get home as fast as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! but you&#8217;re white all right&mdash;you know it
didn&#8217;t say nothing in the book, about what kind of
paint to use!&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell&#8217;s eyes opened. &#8220;What book are you
talking about, Nickey?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one you let me take, with the Indians in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell had to laugh again. &#8220;So that&#8217;s where the
idea for this &#8216;Carnival of Wild West Sports&#8217; originated,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Nickey nodded. &#8220;Everybody wanted
to be the tattooed man, but seeing as I had the book,
and old Charley was my horse, I couldn&#8217;t see any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
good reason why I shouldn&#8217;t get tattooed. Gee! I&#8217;ll
bet ma will be mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>After being properly vested in a cassock two sizes
too large for him, Nickey started on a dead run for
home, and, having reached the barn, dressed himself
in his customary attire. When he appeared at supper
Mrs. Burke did not say anything; but after the
dishes were washed she took him apart and listened
to his version of the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Burke,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if this thing occurs
again I shall punish you in a way you won&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; said Nickey, &#8220;but it
didn&#8217;t seem to feaze Mr. Maxwell a little bit. He
just sat and roared as if he&#8217;d split his sides. I guess
I &#8217;aint goin&#8217; to be put out of the church just yet, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke looked a bit annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about Mr. Maxwell. <i>You</i> won&#8217;t
laugh if anything like this occurs again, I can tell
you,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, ma,&#8221; soothed Nickey, &#8220;don&#8217;t you worry
about it occurrin&#8217; again. You don&#8217;t suppose I did
it on purpose, do you? Gosh no! I wouldn&#8217;t get onto
Charley&#8217;s back again, with my clothes off, any more
than I&#8217;d sit on a hornet&#8217;s nest. How&#8217;d you like to
ride through the town with nothin&#8217; on but your swimmin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
trunks and drippin&#8217; with bluin water, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke did not care to prolong the interview
any further, so she said in her severest tones:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Burke, you go to bed instantly. I&#8217;ve
heard enough of you and seen enough of you, for one
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nickey went.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>ON THE SIDE PORCH</h3>
</div>
<p>In the evening, after his work was done, a day or
two after his talk with Mrs. Maxwell, Jonathan
went into the house and took a long look
at himself in the glass, with the satisfactory conclusion
that he didn&#8217;t look so old after all. Why shouldn&#8217;t
he take Mrs. Betty&#8217;s advice and marry? To be sure,
there was no fool like an old fool, but no man could
be called a fool who was discriminating enough, and
resourceful enough, to win the hand of Hepsey Burke.
To his certain knowledge she had had plenty of eligible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
suitors since her husband&#8217;s death. She was the
acknowledged past-master of doughnuts; and her
pickled cucumbers done in salad oil were dreams of
delight. What more could a man want?</p>
<p>So he found that the question was deciding itself
apparently without any volition whatever on his part.
His fate was sealed; he had lost his heart and his
appetite to his neighbor. Having come to this conclusion,
it was wonderful how the thought excited
him. He took a bath and changed his clothes, and
then proceeded to town and bought himself a white
neck-tie, and a scarf-pin that cost seventy-five cents.
He was going to do the thing in the proper way if he
did it at all.</p>
<p>After supper he mustered sufficient courage to present
himself at the side porch where Mrs. Burke was
knitting on a scarlet sweater for Nickey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evenin&#8217;, Hepsey,&#8221; he began. &#8220;How are you
feelin&#8217; to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not so frisky as I might, Jonathan; I&#8217;d be
all right if it weren&#8217;t for my rheumatiz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we all have our troubles, Hepsey; and if
it isn&#8217;t one thing it&#8217;s most generally another. You
mustn&#8217;t rebel against rheumatiz. It&#8217;s one of those
things sent to make us better, and we must bear up
against it, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Hepsey did not respond to this philosophy, and
Jonathan felt that it was high time that he got down
to business. So he began again:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me as if we might have rain before
long if the wind don&#8217;t change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, Jonathan. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;&#8221; Mrs.
Burke replied, her attention divided
between her visitor and her sweater. &#8220;Got your
hay all in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, most of it. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t be long before the long
fall evenin&#8217;s will be comin&#8217; on, and I kinder dread
&#8217;em. They&#8217;re awful lonesome, Hepsey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Purl two, knit two, an inch and a half&mdash;&#8221; Mrs.
Burke muttered to herself as she read the printed
directions which lay in her lap, and then she added
encouragingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you get lonesome, do you, Jonathan, durin&#8217;
the long evenin&#8217;s, when it gets dark early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, awful lonesome,&#8221; Jonathan responded.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever get lonesome yourself, Hepsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say as it kept me awake nights. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t
bein&#8217; alone that makes you lonesome. The most awful
lonesomeness in the world is bein&#8217; in a crowd
that&#8217;s not your kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Hepsey. But two isn&#8217;t a crowd. Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
you think you&#8217;d like to get married, if you had a right
good chance, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey gave her visitor a quick, sharp glance, and
inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you consider a right good chance,
Jonathan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, suppose that some respectable widower with
a tidy sum in the bank should ask you to marry him;
what would you say, Hepsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say until I&#8217;d seen the widower, to say nothin&#8217;
of the bank book&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan felt that the crisis was now approaching;
so, moving his chair a little nearer, he resumed excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen him, Hepsey; you&#8217;ve seen him lots of
times, and he don&#8217;t live a thousand miles away,
neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Must be he lives in Martin&#8217;s Junction. Is
he good lookin&#8217;, Jonathan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fair to middlin&#8217;. That is&mdash;of course&mdash;I well&mdash;I&mdash;I
should think he was; but tastes differ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know I&#8217;m right particular, Jonathan.
Is he real smart and clever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as&mdash;I ought to&mdash;to&mdash;say, Hepsey;
but I rather guess he knows enough to go in when it
rains.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good as far as it goes. The next time
you see him, you tell him to call around and let me
look him over. Maybe I could give him a job on
the farm, even if I didn&#8217;t want to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t want any job on the farm, Hepsey.
He just wants you, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know he does? Did he ever tell
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey Burke, don&#8217;t you know who I&#8217;m alludin&#8217;
at? Haven&#8217;t you ever suspected nothin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve suspected lots of things. Now there&#8217;s
Jack Dempsey. I&#8217;ve suspected him waterin&#8217; the milk
for some time. Haven&#8217;t you ever suspected anythin&#8217;
yourself, Jonathan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;m suspectin&#8217; that you&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to
make a fool of me, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no! Fools come ready-made, and there&#8217;s a
glut in the market just now; seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten;
no use makin&#8217; more until the supply&#8217;s exhausted.
But what made you think you wanted to marry? This
is so powerful sudden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the point was reached, Jonathan got a
little nervous: &#8220;To&mdash;to tell you the truth, Hepsey,&#8221;
he stuttered, &#8220;I was in doubt about it myself for some
time; but bein&#8217; as I am a Christian man I turned to
the Bible for light on my path.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! And how did the light shine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I just shut my eyes and opened my Bible
at random, and put my finger on a text. Then I
opened my eyes and read what was written.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! What did you find?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read somethin&#8217; about &#8216;not a man of them escaped
save six hundred that rode away on camels.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did that clear up all your difficulties?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, can&#8217;t say as it did. But those words about
&#8216;no man escapin&#8217;&#8217; seemed to point towards matrimony
as far as they went. Then I tried a second
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh did you? I should think that six hundred
camels would be enough for one round-up. What
luck did you have the second time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I read, &#8216;Moab is my wash pot, over Edom
will I cast out my shoe.&#8217; You&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em cast shoes
at the carriages of brides and grooms, haven&#8217;t you,
Hepsey? Just for luck, you know. So it seemed to
point towards matrimony again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jonathan, you certainly have a wonderful
gift for interpretin&#8217; Scripture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Scripture or no Scripture, I want you, Hepsey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to understand that you&#8217;re just fadin&#8217; and
pinin&#8217; away for love of me? You don&#8217;t look thin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we &#8217;aint neither of us as young as we once
was, Hepsey. Of course I can&#8217;t be expected to pine
real hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not the real thing, Jonathan, unless
you pine. Don&#8217;t it keep you awake nights, or
take away your appetite, or make you want to play
the banjo, or nothin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Hepsey; to tell you the plain truth, it don&#8217;t.
But I feel awful lonesome, and I like you a whole lot,
and I&mdash;I love you as much as anyone, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are in love are you, Jonathan. Then let
me give you some good advice. When you&#8217;re in love,
don&#8217;t believe all you think, or half you feel, or anything
at all you are perfectly sure of. It&#8217;s dangerous
business. But I am afraid that you&#8217;re askin&#8217; me because
it makes you think that you are young and
giddy, like the rest of the village boys, to be proposin&#8217;
to a shy young thing like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Hepsey; you aren&#8217;t no shy young thing, and
you haven&#8217;t been for nigh on forty years. I wouldn&#8217;t
be proposin&#8217; to you if you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan, your manners need mendin&#8217; a whole
lot. The idea of insinuatin&#8217; that I am not a shy young
thing. I&#8217;m ashamed of you, and I&#8217;m positive we
could never get along together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t tell a lie about you, even if I do want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
to marry you. You don&#8217;t want to marry a liar, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the fact is, Jonathan, polite lyin&#8217;s the real
foundation of all good manners. What we&#8217;ll ever
do when we get to heaven where we have to tell the
truth whether we want to or not, I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
know. It&#8217;ll be awful uncomfortable until we get
used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The law says you should tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothin&#8217; but the truth,&#8221; persisted the literal
wooer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, Jonathan. Would you say that a
dog&#8217;s tail was false and misleadin&#8217; just because it
isn&#8217;t the whole dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>This proposition was exceedingly confusing to Jonathan&#8217;s
intelligence, but after careful consideration
he felt obliged to say &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Mrs. Burke continued
triumphantly, quickly following up her advantage.
&#8220;You see a dog&#8217;s tail couldn&#8217;t be misleading, &#8217;cause
the dog leads the tail, and not the tail the dog. Any
fool could see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan felt that he had been tricked, although he
could not see just how the thing had been accomplished;
so he began again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Hepsey, we&#8217;re wanderin&#8217; from the point,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
and you&#8217;re just talkin&#8217; to amuse yourself. Can&#8217;t you
come down to business? Here I am a widower, and
here you are a widowess, and we&#8217;re both lonesome,
and we&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you I was lonesome, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course you didn&#8217;t, &#8217;cause you never tell
anything to anyone. But I guessed you was sometimes,
from the looks of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey bent her head over her work and counted
stitches a long time before she looked up. Then she
remarked slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an awful lot of sick people in the world,
and I&#8217;m mighty sorry for &#8217;em; but they&#8217;ll die, or
they&#8217;ll get well. I guess I&#8217;m more sorry for people
who have to go on livin&#8217;, and workin&#8217; hard, when
they&#8217;re just dyin&#8217; for somebody to love &#8217;em, and somebody
to love, until the pain of it hurts like a wisdom
tooth. No, I can&#8217;t afford to be lonesome much, and
that&#8217;s a fact. So I just keep busy, and if I get too
lonesome, I just go and jolly somebody that&#8217;s lonesomer
than I am, and we both feel better; and if I
get lonely lyin&#8217; awake at night, I light a lamp and
read Webster&#8217;s Dictionary. Try it, Jonathan; it&#8217;s a
sure anti-doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again, tryin&#8217; to change the subject,
just when I thought you was goin&#8217; to say somethin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t really want to marry me. I&#8217;m not
young, and I&#8217;m not interestin&#8217;: one or the other you&#8217;ve
just got to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mighty interestin&#8217; to me, Hepsey, anyway;
and&mdash;and you&#8217;re mighty unselfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t throw that in my face; I&#8217;m not
to blame for bein&#8217; unselfish. I&#8217;ve just had to be,
whether I wanted or not. It&#8217;s my misfortune, not my
fault. Lots of people are unselfish because they&#8217;re
too weak to stand up for their own rights.&#8221; She
paused&mdash;and then looked up at him, smiling whimsically,
and added: &#8220;Well, well, Jonathan; see here
now&mdash;I&#8217;ll think it over, and perhaps some day before&mdash;<i>go
&#8217;way</i>, you horrid thing! Let go my hand, I tell
you. There! You&#8217;ve made me drop a whole row of
stitches. If you don&#8217;t run over home right now, before
you&#8217;re tempted to do any more flirtin, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
hold you for breach of promise.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>NICKEY&#8217;S SOCIAL AMBITIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>To Nickey, the Maxwells were in the nature of
a revelation. At his impressionable stage of
boyhood, and because of their freedom from
airs and graces of any kind, he was quick to notice
the difference in type&mdash;&#8220;some class to them; not snobs
or dudes, but the real thing,&#8221; as he expressed it. His
ardent admiration of Donald, and his adoration of
Mrs. Betty, gave him ambition to find the key to their
secret, and to partake of it.</p>
<p>He was too shy to speak of it,&mdash;to his mother last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
of all, as is the nature of a boy,&mdash;and had to rely on
an observant and receptive mind for the earlier steps
in his quest. When Maxwell boarded with them,
Nickey had discovered that he was won&#8217;t to exercise
with dumb-bells each morning before breakfast. The
very keenness of his desire to be initiated, held him
silent. A visit to the town library, on his mother&#8217;s
behalf, chanced to bring his eyes&mdash;generally oblivious
of everything in the shape of a book&mdash;upon the title
of a certain volume designed to instruct in various
parlor-feats of physical prowess.</p>
<p>The book was borrowed from the librarian,&mdash;a
little shamefacedly. The next morning Mrs. Burke
was somewhat alarmed at the noise which came from
Nickey&#8217;s room, and when there was a crash as if the
chimney had fallen, she could stand it no longer,
and hurried aloft. Nickey stood in the middle of
the floor, clad in swimming trunks, gripping a large
weight (purloined from the barn) in either hand,
very red in the face, and much out of breath.</p>
<p>As the door unexpectedly opened he dived for bed
and pulled the clothes under his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land Sakes!&#8221; Hepsey breathed, aghast. &#8220;What&#8217;s
all this about? If there&#8217;s a nail loose in the flooring
I can lend you a hammer for the asking,&#8221; and she examined
several jagged dents in the boards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say ma,&#8221; urged Nickey in moving tones. &#8220;If I&#8217;d
a pair of dumb-bells like Mr. Maxwell&#8217;s, I c&#8217;d hold
onto &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve pretty near smashed my feet with
them things&mdash;gosh darn it,&#8221; he added ruefully, nursing
the bruised member under the clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you can get &#8217;em, next time you go to
Martin&#8217;s Junction; but if it&#8217;s exercise you want,&#8221; his
parent remarked unsympathetically, &#8220;there&#8217;s plenty of
kindlin&#8217; in the woodshed wants choppin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She retired chuckling to herself, as she caught a
glimmer of what was working in her son&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>The &#8220;reading habit&#8221; having been inculcated by
this lucky find at the library, it was not long before
Nickey acquired from the same source a veritable collection
of volumes on the polite arts and crafts&mdash;&#8220;The
Ready Letter-Writer&#8221;; &#8220;Manners Maketh Man&#8221;;
&#8220;Seven Thousand Errors of Speech;&#8221; &#8220;Social Culture
in the Smart Set,&#8221; and the like.</p>
<p>Nickey laboriously studied from these authorities
how to enter a ball room, how to respond to a toast
at a dinner given in one&#8217;s honor, how to propose the
health of his hostess, and how to apologize for treading
on a lady&#8217;s train.</p>
<p>In the secrecy of his chamber he put into practice
the helpful suggestions of these invaluable manuals.
He bowed to the washstand, begged the favor of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
next dance from the towel rack, trod on the window
shade and made the prescribed apology. Then he
discussed the latest novel at dinner with a distinguished
personage; and having smoked an invisible
cigar, interspersed with such wit as accords with walnuts
and wine, after the ladies had retired, he entered
the drawing-room, exchanged parting amenities with
the guests, bade his hostess good night, and gracefully
withdrew to the clothes-press.</p>
<p>Several times Hepsey caught glimpses of him going
through the dumb show of &#8220;Social Culture in the
Smart Set,&#8221; and her wondering soul was filled with
astonishment at his amazing evolutions. She found
it in her heart to speak of it to Mrs. Betty and Maxwell,
and ask for their interpretation of the matter.</p>
<p>So, one day, during this seizure of feverish enthusiasm
for self-culture, Hepsey and Nickey received an
invitation to take supper at the rectory. Nevertheless,
Mrs. Burke thought it prudent to give her son
some good advice in regard to his behavior. She
realized, perhaps, that a book is good so far as it
goes, but is apt to ignore elementals. So she called
him aside before they started:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nickey, remember to act like a gentleman,
especially at the table; you must try to do credit to
your bringin&#8217; up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do my level best if it kills me,&#8221; the boy
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you do with your napkin when you
first sit down to the table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tie it &#8217;round my neck, of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you mustn&#8217;t do anything of the sort; you
must just tuck it in your collar, like any gentleman
would. And when we come home what are you goin&#8217;
to say to Mrs. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll say, &#8216;I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy no! Say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a very nice time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose I didn&#8217;t have a nice time,&mdash;what&#8217;d
I say?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Hepsey struggled to reconcile her
code of ethics with her idea of good manners, and
then replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why say, &#8216;Mrs. Maxwell, it was awfully good of
you to ask me,&#8217; and I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;ll notice anything
wrong about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Nickey retorted scornfully. &#8220;Seems pretty
much like the same thing to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no! Not in the least. Now what will you
wear when we go to the rectory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My gray suit, and tan shoes, and the green tie
with the purple spots on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll be the first to sit down to the table?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Search me&mdash;maybe I will, if there&#8217;s good eats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You must wait for Mrs. Maxwell and
the rector to be seated first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Nickey exclaimed in exasperation, &#8220;I&#8217;m
bound to make some horrible break anyway, so don&#8217;t
you worry, ma. It seems to me from what them
books say, that when you go visitin&#8217; you&#8217;ve got to
tell lies like a sinner; and you can&#8217;t tell the truth till
you get home with the door shut. I never was good
at lyin&#8217;; I always get caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly lyin&#8217;, Nickey; its just sayin&#8217; nice
things, and keepin&#8217; your mouth shut about the rest.
Now suppose you dropped a fork under the table,
what&#8217;d you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say &#8216;&#8217;scuse me, Mrs. Maxwell, but one of the
forks has gone, and you can go through my clothes
if you want to before I go home.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Hepsey remarked dryly, &#8220;I guess the less
you say, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrived at the rectory, Nickey felt under some restraint
when they first sat down to the supper table;
but under the genial manner of Mrs. Maxwell
he soon felt at his ease, and not even his observant
mother detected any dire breach of table etiquette.
His conversation was somewhat spare, his attention
being absorbed and equally divided between observation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
of his host and consumption of the feast set before
him. With sure tact, Mrs. Betty&mdash;though regarding
Nickey as the guest of honor&mdash;that evening&mdash;deferred
testing the results of his conversational
studies until after supper: one thing at once, she decided,
was fair play.</p>
<p>After the meal was over, they repaired together to
the parlor, and while Hepsey took out her wash-rag
knitting and Maxwell smoked his cigar, Mrs. Betty
gave Nickey her undivided attention.</p>
<p>In order to interest the young people of the place
in the missionary work of the parish, Mrs. Betty had
organized a guild of boys who were to earn what they
could towards the support of a missionary in the west.
The Guild had been placed under the fostering care
and supervision of Nickey as its treasurer, and was
known by the name of &#8220;The Juvenile Band of Gleaners.&#8221;
In the course of the evening Mrs. Maxwell
took occasion to inquire what progress they were making,
thereby unconsciously challenging a somewhat
surprising recountal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Nickey replied readily, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got forty-six
cents in the treasury; that&#8217;s just me, you know; I
keep the cash in my pants pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he smiled uneasily, and fidgeted in his chair.</p>
<p>There was something in Nickey&#8217;s tone and look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
that excited Mrs. Betty&#8217;s curiosity, and made his
mother stop knitting and look at him anxiously over
her glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very good for a start,&#8221; Mrs. Betty commended.
&#8220;How did you raise all that, Nickey?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Nickey colored hotly, looked embarrassed,
and made no reply. Then mustering up his
courage, and laughing, he began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Maxwell, it was just like this. Maybe
you won&#8217;t like it, but I&#8217;ll tell you all the same. Bein&#8217;
as I was the president of the Juv&#8217;nul Band of Gleaners,
I though I&#8217;d get the kids together, and start
somethin&#8217;. Saturday it rained cats and dogs, so Billy
Burns, Sam Cooley, Dimple Perkins and me, we went
up into the hay loft, and I said to the kids, &#8216;You fellows
have got to cough up some dough for the church,
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contribute money, Nickey. Don&#8217;t be slangy,&#8221; his
mother interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I says, &#8216;I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; the Juv&#8217;nals, and you&#8217;ve
got to do just what I say. I&#8217;ve got a dandy scheme
for raisin&#8217; money and we&#8217;ll have some fun doin&#8217; it,
or I miss my guess.&#8217; Then I asked Sam Cooley how
much money he&#8217;d got, and Sam, he had forty-four
cents, Billy Burns had fifty-two cents, and Dimple had
only two. Dimp never did have much loose cash, anyway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
But I said to Dimp, &#8216;Never mind, Dimp; you
aint to blame. Your dad&#8217;s an old skinflint. I&#8217;ll lend
you six to start off with.&#8217; Then I made Billy Burns
sweep the floor, while Sam went down to the chicken
yard and caught my bantam rooster, Tooley. Then
I sent Dimp after some chalk, and an empty peach
basket, and a piece of cord. Then we was ready for
business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I marked a big circle on the barn floor with the
chalk, and divided it into four quarters with straight
lines runnin&#8217; through the middle. Then I turned the
peach basket upside down, and tied one end of the
string on the bottom, and threw the other end up over
a beam overhead, so I could pull the basket off from
the floor up to the beam by the string. You see,&#8221;
Nickey illustrated with graphic gestures, &#8220;the basket
hung just over the middle of the circle like a bell.
Then I took the rooster and stuck him under the basket.
Tooley hollered and scratched like Sam Hill and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy sake, Nickey! What will you say
next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, ma, you just wait and see. Well, Tooley
kicked like everything, but he had to go under just
the same. Then I said to the kids to sit around the
circle on the floor, and each choose one of the four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
quarters for hisself,&mdash;one for each of us. &#8216;Now,&#8217; I
said, &#8216;you must each cough up&#8211;&#8211;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh ma, do let me tell it without callin&#8217; me down
every time. &#8216;You kids must hand out a cent apiece
and put it on the floor in your own quarter. Then,
when I say ready, I&#8217;ll pull the string and raise the
basket and let Tooley out. Tooley&#8217;ll get scared and
run. If he runs off the circle through my quarter,
then the four cents are mine; but if he runs through
Dimp&#8217;s quarter, then the four cents are Dimp&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was real excitin&#8217; when I pulled the string, and
the basket went up. You&#8217;d ought to &#8217;ve been there,
Mrs. Maxwell. You&#8217;d have laughed fit to split&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Burke, you must stop talkin&#8217; like that,
or I&#8217;ll send you home,&#8221; reproved Mrs. Burke, looking
severely at her son, and with deprecating side-glances
at his audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, ma. It will be all over in a minute.
But really, you&#8217;d have laughed like sin&mdash;I mean you&#8217;d
have just laughed yourself sick. Tooley was awful
nervous when the basket went up. For a minute he
crouched and stood still, scared stiff at the three kids,
all yellin&#8217; like mad; then he ducked his head and bolted
off the circle through my quarter and flew up on a
beam. I thought the kids would bust.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Burke sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, burst, then. But while they were laughin&#8217; I
raked in the cash. You see I just had to. I won it
for fair. I&#8217;d kept quiet, and that&#8217;s why Tooley come
across my quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Maxwell was sorting over her music, while
Maxwell&#8217;s face was hidden behind a paper. Mrs.
Burke was silent through despair. Nickey glanced
furtively at his hearers for a moment and then continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the kids was tickled; but they got awful quiet
when I told them to fork over another cent apiece for
the jack-pot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the name of conscience is a jack-pot?&#8221;
Hepsey asked.</p>
<p>Donald laughed and Nickey continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;A jack-pot&#8217;s a jack-pot; there isn&#8217;t no other name
that I ever heard of. We caught Tooley and stuck
him under the basket, and made him do it all over
again. You see, every time when Tooley got loose,
the kids all leant forward and yelled like mad; but I
just kept my mouth shut, and leaned way back out of
the way so that Tooley&#8217;d run out through my quarter.
So I won most all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause, while Nickey looked a
bit apprehensively at his audience. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
went on gamely to the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once Tooley made a bolt in a straight line through
Dimp&#8217;s quarter, and hit Dimp in the mouth, and
bowled him over like a nine-pin. Dimp was scared
to death, and howled like murder till he found he&#8217;d
scooped the pot; then he got quiet. After we made
Tooley run ten times, he struck work and wouldn&#8217;t
run any more; so we just had to let him go; but I
didn&#8217;t care nothn&#8217; about that, &#8217;cause you see I had
the kids&#8217; cash in my pants pocket, and that was what I
was after. Well, sir, when it was all over, &#8217;cause I&#8217;d
busted the bank&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Burke, I am ashamed of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, ma; I&#8217;m most through now. When
they found I&#8217;d busted the bank, they looked kind of
blue, and Dimp Perkins said it was a skin game, and
I was a bunco steerer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say to that?&#8221; Donald inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I just said it was all for religion, it was
church money, and it was all right. I was just gleanin&#8217;
what few cents they had, to pay the church debt
to the missionary; and they ought to be ashamed to
have a church debt hangin&#8217; over &#8217;em, and they&#8217;d
oughter be more cheerful &#8217;bout givin&#8217; a little somethin&#8217;
toward raisin&#8217; of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Nickey had finished, there was an ominous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
silence for a moment or two, and then his mother said
sternly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose Mrs. Perkins will say when
she finds that you&#8217;ve tricked her son into a regular
gambling scheme, to get his money away from
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Perkins,&#8221; retorted Nickey, thoroughly
aroused by the soft impeachment. &#8220;I should worry!
At the church fair, before Mr. Maxwell came, she
ran a fancy table, and tried to sell a baby blanket to
an old bachelor; but he wouldn&#8217;t take it. Then when
he wasn&#8217;t lookin&#8217;, blessed if she didn&#8217;t turn around
and tie the four corners together with a bit of ribbon,
and sell it to him for a handkerchief case. She got
two dollars for it, and it wasn&#8217;t worth seventy-five
cents. She was as proud as a dog with two tails, and
went around tellin&#8217; everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence reigned, ominous and general, and Nickey
braced himself for the storm. Even Mrs. Maxwell
didn&#8217;t look at him, and that was pretty bad. He began
to get hot all over, and the matter was fast assuming
a new aspect in his own mind which made him
ashamed of himself. His spirits sank lower and lower.
Finally his mother remarked quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nickey, I thought you were goin&#8217; to be a gentleman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight, all right, what I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; he
murmured abashed.</p>
<p>There was another silent pause&mdash;presently broken
by Nickey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I hadn&#8217;t thought about it, just that way.
I guess I&#8217;ll give the kids their money back,&#8221; he volunteered
despondently&mdash;&#8220;only I&#8217;ll have to make it up,
some way, in the treasury.&#8221; He felt in his pockets,
and jingled the coins.</p>
<p>Another pause&mdash;with only the ticking of his mother&#8217;s
knitting needles to relieve the oppressive silence.
Suddenly the worried pucker disappeared from his
brow, and his face brightened like a sun-burst.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it, Mrs. Maxwell,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
seventy-five cents comin&#8217; to me down at the Variety
Store, for birch-bark frames, and I&#8217;ll give that for the
blamed old missionaries. That&#8217;s square, &#8217;aint it
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Betty&#8217;s commendation and her smile were
salve to the wounds of her young guest, and Donald&#8217;s
hearty laughter soon dispelled the sense of social
failure which was beginning to cloud Nickey&#8217;s happy
spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say Nickey,&#8221; said Maxwell, throwing down his
paper, &#8220;Mrs. Betty and I want to start a Boy Scout
Corps in the parish, and with your resourceful genius
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
you could get the boys together, and explain it to
them, and soon we should have the whole thing in
ship-shape order. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I?&#8221; exclaimed the delighted recruit. &#8220;I guess
so&mdash;but some of &#8217;em &#8217;aint &#8217;Piscopals, Mr. Maxwell;
there&#8217;s Sam Cooley, he&#8217;s a Methodist, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t cut any ice, Nickey,&mdash;excuse my
slang, ladies,&#8221; he apologized to his wife and Hepsey,
at which the boy grinned with delight. &#8220;We&#8217;re out
to welcome all comers. I&#8217;ve got the books that we
shall need upstairs. Let&#8217;s go up to my den and talk
it all over. We shall have to spend evenings getting
thoroughly up in it ourselves,&mdash;rules and knots and
first-aid and the rest. Mrs. Burke will allay parental
anxiety as to the bodily welfare of the recruits and
the pacific object of the organization, and Mrs. Maxwell
will make the colors. Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>With sparkling eyes, Nickey followed Donald out
of the room; as they disappeared Hepsey slowly
shook her head in grateful deprecation at Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless him!&#8221; ejaculated Hepsey. &#8220;Mixin&#8217; up religion,
with a little wholesome fun, is the only way
you can serve it to boys, like Nickey, and get results.
Boys that are ever goin&#8217; to amount to anything are
too full of life to stand &#8217;em up in a row, with a
prayer book in one hand and a hymnal in the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and expect &#8217;em to sprout wings. It can&#8217;t be done.
Keep a boy outside enough and he&#8217;ll turn out alright.
Fresh air and open fields have a mighty helpful influence
on &#8217;em. The way I&#8217;ve got it figgered out, all
of us can absorb a lot of the right kind of religion,
if we&#8217;ll only go out and watch old Mother Nature,
now and then.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>PRACTICAL TEMPERANCE REFORM</h3>
</div>
<p>The small town of Durford was not immune
from the curse of drink: there was no doubt
about that. Other forms of viciousness there
were in plenty; but the nine saloons did more harm
than all the rest of the evil influences put together,
and Maxwell, though far from being a fanatic, was
doing much in a quiet way to neutralize their bad influence.
He turned the Sunday School room into a
reading room during the week days, organized a gymnasium,
kept watch of the younger men individually,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and offered as best he could some chance for the expression
of the gregarious instinct which drew them
together after the work of the day was over. In
the face of his work in these directions, it happened
that a venturesome and enterprising saloon-keeper
bought a vacant property adjacent to the church, and
opened up an aggressive business&mdash;much to Maxwell&#8217;s
dismay.</p>
<p>Among the women of the parish there was a &#8220;Ladies&#8217;
Temperance League,&#8221; of which Mrs. Burke
was president. They held quarterly meetings, and it
was at one of the meetings held at Thunder Cliff,
and at which Mrs. Burke presided, that she remarked
severely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Sapley, you&#8217;re out of order. There&#8217;s a motion
before the house, and I&#8217;ve got something to say
about it myself. Mrs. Perkins, as Mrs. Maxwell
was unable to be present, will you kindly take the
chair, or anything else you can lay your hands on,
and I&#8217;ll say what I&#8217;ve got to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins took Mrs. Burke&#8217;s place as the president,
while Mrs. Burke rubbed her glasses in an impatient
way; and having adjusted them, began in a
decided tone from which there was meant to be no
appeal:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, ladies, we&#8217;re not gettin&#8217; down to business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
as we ought to, if we are to accomplish anything.
We&#8217;ve been singing hymns, and recitin&#8217; lovely poems,
and listenin&#8217; to reports as to how money spent for
liquor would pay off the national debt; and we&#8217;ve been
sayin&#8217; prayers, and pledgin&#8217; ourselves not to do things
none of us ever was tempted to do, or thought of
doin&#8217;, and wearin&#8217; ribbons, and attendin&#8217; conventions,
and talkin&#8217; about influencin&#8217; legislation at Washington,
and eatin&#8217; sandwiches, and drinkin&#8217; weak tea, and
doin&#8217; goodness knows what; but we&#8217;ve not done a
blessed thing to stop men drinkin&#8217; right here in Durford
and breakin&#8217; the town law; you know that well
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke paused for breath after this astounding
revolutionary statement, and there was a murmur of
scandalized dissent from the assembled ladies at this
outspoken expression on the part of the honorable
president of the Parish Guild.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she continued emphatically, &#8220;don&#8217;t you fool
yourselves. If we can&#8217;t help matters right here where
we live, then there&#8217;s no use havin&#8217; imitation church
sociables, and goin&#8217; home thinkin&#8217; we&#8217;ve helped the
temperance cause, and callin&#8217; everybody else bad
names who don&#8217;t exactly agree with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there were symptoms of open rebellion
against this traitorous heresy on the part of the plainspoken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
president; but she was not to be easily silenced;
so she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Men have got to go somewheres when their work
is over, and have a good time, and I believe that we
won&#8217;t accomplish anything until we fix up a nice, attractive
set of rooms with games, and give &#8217;em something
to drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cries of &#8220;Oh! Oh! Oh!&#8221; filled the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say whiskey, did I? Anybody would
think I&#8217;d offered to treat you, the way you receive
my remarks. Now we can&#8217;t get the rooms right off,
&#8217;cause we can&#8217;t yet afford to pay the rent of &#8217;em. But
there&#8217;s one thing we can do. There&#8217;s Silas Bingham&mdash;the
new man. He&#8217;s gone and opened a saloon
within about a hundred feet of the church, and he&#8217;s
sellin&#8217; liquor to children and runnin&#8217; a slot machine
besides. It&#8217;s all against the law; but if you think
the village trustees are goin&#8217; to do anythin&#8217; to enforce
the law, you&#8217;re just dead wrong, every one of you.
The trustees are most of &#8217;em in it for graft, and
they &#8217;aint goin&#8217; to close no saloon when it&#8217;s comin&#8217;
election day &#8217;for long, not if Bingham serves cocktails
between the hymns in church. Maybe the trustees&#8217;d
come to church better if he did. Maybe you
think I&#8217;m usin&#8217; strong language; but it&#8217;s true all the
same, and you know it&#8217;s true. Silas Bingham&#8217;s move
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
is a sassy challenge to us: are we goin&#8217; to lie down
under it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say that I&#8217;m painfully surprised at you,
Mrs. Burke,&#8221; Mrs. Burns began. &#8220;You surely can&#8217;t
forget what wonderful things the League has accomplished
in Virginia and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Burke interrupted, &#8220;but you see Durford
&#8217;aint in Virginia so far as heard from, and it&#8217;s
our business to get up and hustle right here where we
live. Did you think we were tryin&#8217; to reform Virginia
or Alaska by absent treatment?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sapley could not contain herself another moment;
so, rising to her feet excitedly she sputtered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not agree with you, Mrs. Burke; I do not
agree with you at all. Our meetings have been very
inspiring and helpful to us all, I am perfectly sure;
very uplifting and encouraging; and I am astonished
that you should speak as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you&#8217;ve found them so, Mrs. Sapley.
I don&#8217;t drink myself, and I don&#8217;t need no encouragin&#8217;
and upliftin&#8217;. It&#8217;s the weak man that drinks who
needs encouragin&#8217; and upliftin&#8217;; and he wouldn&#8217;t come
near one of our meetin&#8217;s any more than a bantam
rooster would try to hatch turtles from moth-balls.
We&#8217;ve got to clear Silas Bingham from off the church
steps.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mrs. Burns inquired, &#8220;what do you propose
to do about it, if I may be allowed to inquire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? The first thing I propose to do is to interview
Silas Bingham myself privately, and see what I
can do with him. Perhaps I won&#8217;t accomplish nothin&#8217;;
but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to try, anyway, and make him get
out of that location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, if anybody can,&#8221; Mrs. Sapley remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the compliment, Mrs. Sapley.
Now Mrs. President, I move, sir&mdash;that is, madam&mdash;that
the parish League appoints me to interview
Bingham.&#8221;</p>
<p>The motion was duly seconded and passed, notwithstanding
some mild protests from the opposition,
and Mrs. Burke resumed her place as presiding officer
of the meeting. Then she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me; I forgot the previous question which
somebody moved. Shall we have lettuce or chicken
sandwiches at our next meetin&#8217;? You have heard the
question. Those in favor of chicken please say aye.
Ah! The ayes have the chicken, and the chicken is
unanimously carried. Any more business to come before
the meetin&#8217;? If not, we&#8217;ll proceed to carry out
the lit&#8217;ary program arranged by Miss Perkins. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
we&#8217;ll close this meetin&#8217; by singin&#8217; the 224th hymn.
Don&#8217;t forget the basket by the door.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Silas Bingham was an undersized, timid, pulpy
soul, with a horizontal forehead, watery blue eyes,
and a receding chin. Out of &#8220;office hours&#8221; he looked
like a meek solicitor for a Sunday School magazine.
One bright morning just as he had finished sweeping
out the saloon and was polishing the brass rod on the
front of the bar, Mrs. Burke walked in, and extended
her hand to the astonished bar-keeper, whose chin
dropped from sheer amazement. She introduced herself
in the most cordial and sympathetic of tones,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Bingham? I haven&#8217;t had
the pleasure of meetin&#8217; you before; but I always make
it a point to call on strangers when they come to
town. It must be awful lonesome when you first arrive
and don&#8217;t know a livin&#8217; soul. I hope your wife is
tolerable well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bingham gradually pulled himself together and
turned very red, as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! But my wife doesn&#8217;t live here. It&#8217;s
awful kind of you, I&#8217;m sure; but you&#8217;ll find my wife
in the third house beyond the bakery, down two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
blocks&mdash;turn to the right. She&#8217;ll be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; Hepsey responded, &#8220;but you see I
don&#8217;t have much to do on Thursdays, and I&#8217;ll just
have a little visit with you, now I&#8217;m here. Fine day,
isn&#8217;t it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke drew up a chair and sat down, adjusted
her feet comfortably to the rung of another chair,
and pulled out her knitting from her work-bag, much
to the consternation of the proprietor of the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;How nice you&#8217;ve got things fixed up, Mr. Bingham,&#8221;
Hepsey remarked, gazing serenely at the seductive
variety of bottles and glasses, and the glare of
mirrors behind the bar. &#8220;Nothin&#8217; like havin&#8217; a fine
lookin&#8217; place to draw trade. Is business prosperin&#8217;
now-a-days?&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas turned three shades redder, and stammered
badly as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m doin&#8217; as well as I can expect&mdash;er&mdash;I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably as well as your customers are doin&#8217;, I
should imagine? You don&#8217;t need to get discouraged.
It takes time to work up a trade like yours in a nice,
decent neighborhood like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas stared hard at the unwelcome intruder, glancing
apprehensively at the door from which several
customers had already turned away when, through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
glass, they had caught sight of Mrs. Burke. He was
desperately ill at ease, and far from responding cordially
to Hepsey&#8217;s friendly advances; and his nervousness
increased as his patrons continually retreated,
occasionally grinning derisively at him through
the glass in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind my sayin&#8217; it, Mrs. Burke, I
think you&#8217;d be a lot more comfortable at my house
than you are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m perfectly comfortable, thanks; perfectly
comfortable. Don&#8217;t you worry a bit about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is a saloon, and it &#8217;aint just what you
might call respectable for ladies to be sittin&#8217; in a
saloon, now, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Why not?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was so sudden, sharp and unexpected
that Silas jumped and almost knocked over a bottle of
gin, and then stared in silent chagrin at his guest, his
nervous lips moving without speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; Hepsey continued, &#8220;just why the men
should have all the fun, and then when a woman
takes to enjoyin&#8217; herself say that it isn&#8217;t respectable.
What&#8217;s the difference, I&#8217;d like to know? This is a
right cheerful place, and I feel just like stayin&#8217; as
long as I want to. There&#8217;s no law against a woman
goin&#8217; to a saloon, is there? I saw Jane Dwire come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
out of here Saturday night. To be sure, Jane &#8217;aint
just what you&#8217;d call a &#8216;society&#8217; lady, as you might say;
but as long as I behave myself I don&#8217;t see why I
should go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Silas protested in wrathful desperation,
&#8220;I must ask you to go. You&#8217;ll hurt my trade
if you stay here any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt your trade! Nonsense! You aren&#8217;t half as
polite as I thought you were. I&#8217;m awful popular
with the gentlemen. You ought to be payin&#8217; me a
commission to sit here and entertain your customers,
instead of insinuatin&#8217; that I &#8217;aint welcome. Ah! Here
comes Martin Crowfoot. Haven&#8217;t seen Martin in
the longest time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin slouched in and reached the bar and ordered
before he caught sight of Mrs. Burke. He was
just raising the glass to his lips when Hepsey stepped
up briskly, and extending her hand, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Martin? How are the folks at
home? Awful glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin stared vacantly at Mrs. Burke, dropped his
glass, and muttered incoherently. Then he bolted
hastily from the place without paying for his drink.</p>
<p>Bingham was now getting a bit hysterical over the
situation, and was about to make another vigorous
protest, when Hiram Green entered and called for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
some beer. Again Hepsey extended her hand cordially,
and Hiram jumped as if he had seen a ghost&mdash;for
they had been friendly for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey Burke, what in the name of all that&#8217;s decent
are you doin&#8217; in a place like this?&#8221; he demanded
when he could get his breath. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
you&#8217;ll ruin your reputation if you&#8217;re seen sittin&#8217; in a
saloon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let that worry you, Hiram, My reputation&#8217;d
freeze a stroke of lightnin&#8217;. You don&#8217;t seem
to be worryin&#8217; much about your own reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well, a man can do a lot of things a woman
can&#8217;t, without losin&#8217; his reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant the color flamed into Mrs. Burke&#8217;s
face as she retorted hotly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s the whole business. A man can drink,
and knock the seventh commandment into a cocked
hat; and then when he wants to settle down and get
married he demands a wife as white as snow. If he
gets drunk, it&#8217;s a lark. If she gets drunk, it&#8217;s a crime.
But I didn&#8217;t come here to preach or hold a revival,
and as for my welfare and my reputation, Mr. Bingham
and I was just havin&#8217; a pleasant afternoon together
when you came in and interrupted us. He&#8217;s
awful nice when you get to know him real intimate.
Now, Hiram, I hate to spoil your fun, and you do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
look a bit thirsty. Suppose you have a lemonade on
me, if you&#8217;re sure it won&#8217;t go to your head. It isn&#8217;t
often that we get out like this together. Lemonades
for two, Mr. Bingham; and make Hiram&#8217;s real
sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke enjoyed hugely the disgust and the
grimaces with which Green swallowed the syrupy
mixture. He then beat a hasty retreat down the
street. For two hours Hepsey received all who were
courageous enough to venture in, with most engaging
smiles and cordial handshakes, until Silas was bordering
on madness. Finally he emerged from the bar
and mustered up sufficient courage to threaten:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, if you don&#8217;t quit, I&#8217;ll send for the
police,&#8221; he blustered.</p>
<p>Hepsey gazed calmly at her victim and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, if I was in your place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, I give you fair warning I&#8217;ll put you
out myself if you don&#8217;t go peaceable in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Silas; you&#8217;re wrong as usual. You can&#8217;t put
me out of here until I&#8217;m ready to go. I could wring
you out like a mop, and drop you down a knot-hole,
and nobody&#8217;d be the wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door now opened slowly and a small girl, miserably
clad, entered the saloon. Her head was covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
with a worn, soiled shawl. From underneath
the shawl she produced a battered tin pail and placed
it on the bar with the phlegmatic remark, &#8220;Pa wants
a quart of beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke looked at the girl and then at Bingham,
and then back at the girl inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in the habit of gettin&#8217; beer here, child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; the girl replied, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten, goin&#8217; on eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you sell it to her?&#8221; Hepsey asked, turning
to Bingham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s for her father. He sends for it.&#8221; He
frowned at the child and she quickly disappeared,
leaving the can behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he? But I thought you said that a saloon
was no place for a woman; and surely it can&#8217;t be a
decent place for a girl under age. Now my friend,
I&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the very devil and all,&#8221; Silas remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Silas. The devil sticks to his job, anyway;
and owin&#8217; to the likes of you he wins out, nine
times out of ten. Now will you clear out of this
location, or won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another day like this would send me to the lunatic
asylum.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be around in the mornin&#8217; at six-thirty
sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You just get out of here,&#8221; he threatened.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you promise to clear out yourself within three
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d clear out of Heaven itself to get rid
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; and if you are still here Saturday afternoon,
ten of us women will come and sit on your
steps until you go. A woman can&#8217;t vote whether you
shall be allowed to entice her men-folk into a place
like this, and at the very church door; but the average
woman can be mighty disagreeable when she
tries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas Bingham had a good business head: he reckoned
up the costs&mdash;and cleared out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>NOTICE TO QUIT</h3>
</div>
<p>Before the year was over Mrs. Betty had become
popular with Maxwell&#8217;s parishioners
through her unfailing good-nature, cordiality
and persistent optimism. Even Mrs. Nolan, who
lived down by the bridge, and made rag carpets, and
suffered from chronic dyspepsia, remarked to Mrs.
Burke that she thought the parson&#8217;s wife was very
nice &#8220;&#8217;cause she &#8217;aint a bit better than any of the rest
of us,&#8221;&mdash;which tribute to Mrs. Betty&#8217;s tact made
Mrs. Burke smile and look pleased. All the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
men and girls of the parish simply adored her, and it
was marvelous how she managed to keep in touch
with all the guilds, do her own housework, and learn
to know everyone intimately. Hepsey warned her
that she was attempting to do too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best parson&#8217;s wife,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is the one who
makes the rest work, while she attends to her own
household, and keeps her health. Her business is not
to do the work of the parson, but to look after him,
keep him well nourished, and cheer him up a little bit
when he is tempted to take the next trolley for Timbuctoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The retort was so tempting that Mrs. Betty could
not help saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a person in this town who does so
much for others as you do, and who makes so little
fuss about it. It&#8217;s the force of your example that has
led me astray, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Hepsey replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you called my
attention to it. I shall try to break myself of the
habit at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Maxwell, his practical helpfulness in forwarding
the social life of the place, without in the
least applying that phase of his activities as a lever
for spiritual upheavals, and his ready sympathy for
and interest in the needs and doings of young and old,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
irrespective of class or caste, gradualy reaped for him
the affection and respect of all sorts and conditions.
In fact, the year had been a pleasant one for him, and
was marred by only one circumstance, the continued
and growing hostility of his Senior Warden, Mr.
Bascom. From the first, he had been distinctly unfriendly
towards his rector; but soon after Maxwell&#8217;s
marriage, his annoying opposition was quite open and
pronounced, and the weight of his personal influence
was thrown against every move which Maxwell made
towards the development of the parish life and work.</p>
<p>To those more &#8220;in the know&#8221; than the Maxwells
themselves, it was evident that a certain keen aggressiveness
evinced by the Senior Warden was foreign to
his phlegmatic, brooding character, and it was clear
to them that the actively malicious virus was being
administered by the disappointed Virginia. That she
was plotting punishment, in revenge for wounded
<i>amour propre</i>, was clear to the initiated, who were
apprehensive of the bomb she was evidently preparing
to burst over the unconscious heads of the rector and
his wife. But what could her scheme be?</p>
<p>Gradually Mrs. Burke noticed that Betty began to
show fatigue and anxiety, and was losing the freshness
of her delicate color; while Donald had become
silent and reserved, and wore a worried look which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
was quite unnatural to him. Something was going
wrong; of that she felt sure; but observant though
she was, she failed to trace the trouble to its source.</p>
<p>Matters came to a crisis one day when Maxwell
was informed that some one was waiting to see him
in the parlor. The visitor was dressed in very pronounced
clothes, and carried himself with a self-assertive
swagger. Maxwell had seen him in Bascom&#8217;s
office, and knew who was waiting for him long
before he reached the parlor, by the odor of patchouli
which penetrated to the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Nelson,&#8221; said Maxwell.
&#8220;Did you wish to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, Mr. Maxwell, and I am sure it is a
great pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man seated himself comfortably in a large
chair, put the tips of his fingers together, and gazed
about the room with an expression of pleased patronage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very pretty home you have here,&#8221; he remarked
suavely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Maxwell replied. &#8220;We manage to make
ourselves comfortable. Did you wish to see me on
business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; the lawyer replied, &#8220;a mere technicality.
I represent the firm of Bascom &amp; Nelson, or rather I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
should say I am Mr. Bascom&#8217;s legal agent just at
present, as I have not yet been admitted as his partner&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stopped, smirked, and evidently relished
prolonging his interview with Maxwell, who was getting
impatient. Maxwell drew his watch from his
pocket, and there was a look in his eyes which made
the lawyer proceed:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, Rector, that I came to see you on a
matter of business about the rectory&mdash;as Mr. Bascom&#8217;s
agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you kindly state it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It concerns the use of this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way? This is the rectory of the church,
and the rental of it is part of my salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken. Mr. Bascom owns the house,
and you are staying here merely on sufferance.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Maxwell was too astonished to
speak; then he began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Bascom owns this house? What do you
mean? The house is part of the property of the
church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will kindly not repeat that form of address,
and explain what you mean,&#8221; replied Maxwell heatedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come; there&#8217;s no use in losing your temper,
my dear rector,&#8221; retorted Nelson offensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have just two minutes to explain yourself,
sir; and I strongly advise you to improve the opportunity,
before I put you out of this house.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson, like most bullies, was a coward, and evidently
concluded that he would take no risks. He
continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said before, Sylvester Bascom practically
owns this house. It does not belong to the church
property. The Episcopals made a big bluff at buying
it years ago, and made a very small payment in cash;
Bascom took a mortgage for the rest. The interest
was paid regularly for a while, and then payments
began to fall off. As you have reason to know, Bascom
is a generous and kind-hearted man, who would
not for the world inconvenience his rector, and so he
has allowed the matter to go by default, until the back
interest amounts to a considerable sum. Of course
the mortgage is long past due, and as he needs the
money, he has commissioned me to see you and inform
you that he is about to foreclose, and to ask you
to vacate the premises as soon as you conveniently
can. I hope that I make myself reasonably clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a perfectly steady voice Maxwell replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;What you say is clear enough; whether it is true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
is another matter. I will see Mr. Bascom at once,
and ask for his own statement of the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it necessary to see him, as he has
expressly authorized me to act for him in the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose you came her to serve the notice
of ejectment on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we won&#8217;t use such strong language as that.
I came here merely to tell you that the house must be
vacated soon as possible. Mr. Bascom has gone to
New York on business and will not be back for two
weeks. Meantime he wishes the house vacated, so
that he can rent it to other parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When does the Senior Warden propose to eject
his rector, if I may be allowed to ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there is no immediate hurry. Any time this
week will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he want for this place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he expects fifteen dollars a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course that is prohibitive. Tell Mr. Bascom
that we will surrender the house on Wednesday,
and that we are greatly indebted to him for allowing
us to occupy it rent-free for so long a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Donald showed the objectionable visitor out of
the house, he caught sight of Hepsey Burke walking
towards it. He half hoped she would pass by, but
with a glance of suspicion and barely civil greeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to Nelson as he walked away, she came on, and with
a friendly nod to Maxwell entered the rectory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been talkin&#8217; to Mrs. Betty for her good,&#8221;
she remarked. &#8220;I met her in town, lookin&#8217; as peaked
as if she&#8217;d been fastin&#8217; double shifts, and I had a
notion to come in and complete the good work on
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell&#8217;s worried face told its own story. He was
so nonplused by the bolt just dropped from the blue
that he could find no words of responsive raillery
wherewith to change the subject.</p>
<p>Hepsey led the way to the parlor and seated herself,
facing him judicially. In her quick mind the
new evidence soon crystallized into proof of her already
half-formed suspicions. She came straight to
the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Bascom making you any trouble? If he is,
say so, &#8217;cause I happen to have the whip-hand so far
as he&#8217;s concerned. That Nelson&#8217;s nothin&#8217; but a tool
of his, and a dull tool at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an objectionable person, I must say,&#8221; remarked
Maxwell, and hesitated to trust himself
further.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke gazed at Maxwell for some time in
silence and then began:</p>
<p>&#8220;You look about done up&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to be pryin&#8217;,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
but I guess you&#8217;d better own up. Something&#8217;s
the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just worried and anxious, and I suppose I
can&#8217;t help showing it,&#8221; he replied wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re worried, are you. Now don&#8217;t you get
the worried habit; if it makes a start it will grow on
you till you find yourself worryin&#8217; for fear the moon
won&#8217;t rise. Worryin&#8217;s like usin&#8217; rusty scissors: it sets
your mouth awry. You just take things as they come,
and when it seems as if everything was goin&#8217; to smash
and you couldn&#8217;t help it, put on your overalls and
paint a fence, or hammer tacks, or any old thing that
comes handy. What has that rascal Bascom been
doin&#8217;? Excuse me&mdash;my diplomacy&#8217;s of the hammer-and-tongs
order; you&#8217;re not gettin&#8217; your salary paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>For some time Maxwell hesitated and then answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I might as well tell you, because you
will know all about it anyway in a day or two, and
you might as well get a correct version of the affair
from me, though I hate awfully to trouble you. The
parish owes me two hundred and fifty dollars. I spoke
to Reynolds about it several times, but he says that
Bascom and several of his intimate friends won&#8217;t pay
their subscriptions promptly, and so he can&#8217;t pay me.
But the shortage in my salary is not the worst of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Did you know that the rectory was heavily mortgaged,
and that Bascom holds the mortgage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew it; but we paid something down&#8217;, and
the interest&#8217;s been kept up, and we hoped that if we
did that Bascom would be satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the interest has not been paid in some
time, and the real reason why Nelson called just now
was to inform me that as Bascom was about to foreclose
we must get out as soon as we could. I told him
that we would leave on Wednesday next.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment there was a look on Mrs. Burke&#8217;s
face which Maxwell never had seen before, and which
boded ill for Bascom: but she made no immediate
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; she said finally, &#8220;I have
been afraid of this. That was the only thing that
worried me about your gettin&#8217; married. But I felt
that no good would come from worryin&#8217;, and that if
Bascom was goin&#8217; to play you some dirty trick, he&#8217;d
do it; and now he&#8217;s done it. What&#8217;s got into the man,
all of a sudden? He&#8217;s a skinflint&mdash;always closer than
hair to a dog&#8217;s back; but I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve ever
known him do somethin&#8217; downright ugly, like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know well enough,&#8221; remarked Donald. &#8220;If
I had been aware of how matters stood about the rectory,
I should have acted differently. I wrote him a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
pretty stiff letter a day or two ago, calling upon him,
as Senior Warden, to use his influence to fulfill the
contract with me, and get the arrears of my salary
paid up. I suppose he had thought I would just get
out of the place if my salary was held back&mdash;and he&#8217;s
wanted to get rid of me for some time. Now, he&#8217;s
taken this other means of ejecting me not only from
his house but from the town itself. He knows I can&#8217;t
afford to pay the rent out of my salary&mdash;let alone out
of half of it!&#8221; He laughed rather bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be singing a different tune, before I&#8217;ve done
with him,&#8221; said Hepsey. &#8220;Now you leave this to me&mdash;I&#8217;ll
have a twitch on old Bascom&#8217;s nose that&#8217;ll make
him think of something else than ejecting his rector.
I&#8217;ll go and visit with him a little this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Nelson said that he was in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know better than that,&#8221; snorted Hepsey. &#8220;But
I guess he&#8217;ll want to go there, and stay the winter
there too, maybe, when I&#8217;ve had my say. No sir&mdash;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to take my knittin&#8217; up to his office, and sit
awhile; and if he doesn&#8217;t have the time of his life it
won&#8217;t be my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to leave the room, with a belligerent
swing of her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke,&#8221; said Maxwell gently, &#8220;you are kindness
itself; but I don&#8217;t want you to do this&mdash;at least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
not yet. I want to fight this thing through myself,
and rather to shame Bascom into doing the right thing
than force him to do it&mdash;even if the latter were possible.
I must think things out a bit. I shall want your
help&mdash;we always do, Betty and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but you&#8217;re right; but if your plan
don&#8217;t work, remember mine <i>will</i>. Well, Mrs. Betty&#8217;ll
be coming in soon, and I&#8217;ll leave you. Meantime I
shall just go home and load my guns: I&#8217;m out for
Bascom&#8217;s hide, sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE NEW RECTORY</h3>
</div>
<p>When Betty returned, and Donald told her
the happenings of the morning, the clouds
dispersed somewhat, and before long the
dictum that &#8220;there is humor in all things&#8221;&mdash;even in
ejection from house and home&mdash;seemed proven true.
After lunch they sat in Donald&#8217;s den, and were laughingly
suggesting every kind of habitat, possible and
impossible, from purchasing and fitting up the iceman&#8217;s
covered wagon and perambulating round the
town, to taking a store and increasing their income
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
by purveying Betty&#8217;s tempting preserves and confections.</p>
<p>Their consultation was interrupted by the arrival
of Nickey, armed with a Boy Scouts&#8217; &#8220;Manual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! Mr. Maxwell: Uncle Jonathan Jackson&#8217;s
all right; I&#8217;ll never do another thing to guy him. He&#8217;s
loaned us his tent for our Boy Scouts&#8217; corpse, and
I&#8217;ve been studyin&#8217; out how to pitch it proper, so I
can show the kids the ropes; but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald!&#8221; cried Betty. &#8220;The very thing&mdash;let&#8217;s
camp out on the church lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jinks!&#8221; exclaimed Maxwell, unclerically.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have that tent up this very afternoon&mdash;if
Nickey will lend it to us, second hand, and get his
men together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nickey flushed with delight. &#8220;You betcher life I
will,&#8221; he shouted excitedly. &#8220;Is it for a revival
stunt? You &#8217;aint goin&#8217; to live there, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we are going to do, if Jonathan
and you&#8217;ll lend us the tent for a few months. Mr.
Bascom wants to let the rectory to some other tenants,
and we&#8217;ve got to find somewhere else to lay our
heads. Why, it&#8217;s the very way! There&#8217;s not a thing
against it, that I can see. Let&#8217;s go and see the tent,
and consult Mrs. Burke. Come along, both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And off they hurried, like three children bent on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
new game. It was soon arranged, and Hepsey rose
to the occasion with her usual vim. To her and Nickey
the transportation of the tent was consigned, while
Maxwell went off to purchase the necessary boarding
for a floor, and Mrs. Betty returned to the rectory
to pack up their belongings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to occupy our new quarters to-night,&#8221;
said Maxwell, &#8220;or our friend the enemy may raid the
church lot in the night, and vanish with tent and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour or so later, when Maxwell arrived at the
church, clad in overalls and riding on a wagon of
planks, he found Mrs. Burke and Nickey with a contingent
of stalwarts awaiting him. There was a heap
of canvas and some coils of rope lying on the ground
near by. Hepsey greeted him with a smile from under
the shade of her sun-bonnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem ready for business, even if you don&#8217;t
look a little bit like the Archbishop of Canterbury in
that rig,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;ll be an
awful scandal in the parish if you go wanderin&#8217; around
dressed like a carpenter; but it can&#8217;t be helped; and
if the Bishop excommunicates you, I&#8217;ll give you a job
on the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind about the looks of it; but I suppose
the vestry will have something to say about our camping
on church property.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That needn&#8217;t worry you. Maybe it&#8217;ll bring &#8217;em
to their senses, and maybe, they&#8217;ll be ashamed when
they see their parson driven out of his house and
havin&#8217; to live in a tent,&mdash;though I &#8217;aint holdin&#8217; out
much hope of that, to you. Folks that are the most
religious are usually the hardest to shame. I always
said, financially speakin&#8217;, that preachin&#8217; wasn&#8217;t a sound
business. It&#8217;s all give and no get; but this is the first
time I&#8217;ve ever heard of a parish wanting a parson to
preach without eating and to sleep without a roof over
his head. Most of us seem to forget that rectors are
human being like the rest of us. If religion is worth
havin&#8217;, it&#8217;s worth payin&#8217; for.&#8221;</p>
<p>The planking was soon laid, and the erection of the
tent was left to Nickey&#8217;s captaining&mdash;all hands assisting.
With his manual in one hand he laid it out, rope
by rope, poles in position, and each helper at his place.
Then at a word, up it soared, with a &#8220;bravo&#8221; from
the puzzled onlookers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want a poet here,&#8221; laughed Maxwell. &#8220;Longfellow&#8217;s
&#8216;Building of the Ship,&#8217; or Ralph Connor&#8217;s
&#8216;Building the Barn&#8217; aren&#8217;t a circumstance to Nickey&#8217;s
&#8216;Pitching the Parson&#8217;s Tent.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was next divided off into three convenient rooms,
for sleeping, eating and cooking&mdash;and Hepsey, with
three scouts, having driven across to the old rectory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
while the finishing touches were being put to the new,
she and her military escort soon returned with Mrs.
Betty, and a load of furniture and other belongings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is perfect!&#8221; cried Betty. &#8220;The only
thing lacking to complete the illusion is a trout brook
in the front yard, and the smell of pines and the damp
mossy earth of the forests. We&#8217;ll wear our old
clothes, and have a bonfire at night, and roast potatoes
and corn in the hot coals, and have the most beautiful
time imaginable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The town visitors who still lingered on the scene
were received cordially by Maxwell and Mrs. Betty,
who seemed to be in rather high spirits; but when the
visitors made any inquiries concerning structural matters
they were politely referred to Nickey Burke for
any information they desired, as he had assumed official
management of the work.</p>
<p>Just before the various helpers left at six o&#8217;clock,
smoke began to issue from the little stove-pipe sticking
out through the canvas of the rear of the tent,
and Mrs. Betty, with her sleeves rolled up to her elbows
and her cooking apron on, came out to watch it
with all the pride of a good housekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it jolly, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I was
afraid that it would not draw, but it really does,
you see. This will be more fun than a month at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
seashore; and to-morrow we are going to have you
and Nickey dine with us in the tent; so don&#8217;t make
any other engagement. Don&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>By noon of the following day everybody in town
knew that the Maxwells had been dispossessed, and
were camping on the church lot; and before night
most of the women and a few of the men had called
to satisfy their curiosity, and to express their sympathy
with the rector and his wife, who, however,
seemed to be quite comfortable and happy in their
new quarters. On the other hand, some of the vestry
hinted strongly that tents could not be put up on church
property without their formal permission, and a few
of the more pious suggested that it was little short of
sacrilege thus to violate the sanctity of a consecrated
place. Nickey had painted a large sign with the word
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Rectory</span> on it, in truly rustic lettering, and had hung
it at the entrance of the tent. The Editor of the
Durford Daily <i>Bugle</i> appeared with the village
photographer, and after an interview with Maxwell
requested him and his wife to pose for a picture in
front of the tent. This they declined with thanks;
but a half-column article giving a sensational account
of the affair appeared in the next issue of the paper,
headed by a half-tone picture of the tent and the
church. Public sentiment ran strongly against Bascom,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
to whom rumor quickly awarded the onus of the
incident. In reply to offers of hospitality, Maxwell
and Mrs. Betty insisted that they were very comfortable
for the time being, and were not going to move
or make any plans for the immediate future. The
morning of the fourth day, Maxwell announced to
Mrs. Betty that he had a strong presentiment that
Bascom would soon make another move in the game,
and he was not surprised when he saw Nelson approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness we are in the open air, this time,&#8221;
Maxwell remarked to Betty as he caught sight of the
visitor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to him outside&mdash;and perhaps you&#8217;d
better shut the door and keep out the language. I
may have to express myself more forcibly than politely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson began:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have to intrude upon you again, Mr.
Maxwell, but I must inform you that you will have
to vacant that tent and find lodgings elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, pray? This tent is my property for as long
as I require it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! But you see it has been put up on the land
that belongs to the church, and you have no title to
use the land, you know, for private purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; Maxwell replied, &#8220;but while the legal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
title to all church property is held by the wardens and
vestry collectively, the freehold use of the church
building and grounds is held by the rector for the
purpose of the exercise of his office as rector. No
church property is injured by this tent. This lot was
originally purchased for a rectory. To all intents and
purposes (excuse me; I am not punning) this tent is
the rectory <i>pro tem</i>. The use of a rectory was offered
me as part of the original agreement when I accepted
the call to come to this parish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! You speak quite as if you belonged to the
legal profession yourself, Mr. Maxwell. However,
I am afraid that you will have to get off the lot just
the same. You must remember that I am simply
carrying out Mr. Bascom&#8217;s instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; please give my compliments to Mr.
Bascom and tell him that he is welcome to come here
and put me out as soon as he thinks best. Moreover,
you might remind him that he is not an autocrat, and
that he cannot take any legal action in the matter without
a formal meeting of the vestry, which I will call
and at which I will preside. He can appeal to the
Bishop if he sees fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I understand that you propose to stay where
you are, in defiance of Mr. Bascom&#8217;s orders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I most certainly do. It is well known that Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
Bascom has successfully intimidated every one of my
predecessors; but he has met his match for once. I
shall not budge from this tent until I see fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should be very sorry to see you forcibly
ejected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste any sympathy on me, sir. If Mr.
Bascom attempts to molest me, I shall take the matter
to the courts and sue him for damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your language is somewhat forcible, considering
that you are supposed to be his pastor and spiritual
advisor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; tell Mr. Bascom that as his spiritual
advisor I strongly suggest that his spiritual condition
will not be much improved by attempting to molest
us here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But to be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Maxwell,
he can force you to leave, by stopping the payment
of your salary, even if he does not eject you by
force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think not. Until he can bring specific
charges against me, he is liable for the fulfillment of
our original contract, in his writing. Moreover, I
may have more friends in the parish than he imagines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson was visibly disturbed by the rector&#8217;s firm
hold on the situation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he stuttered, &#8220;Mr. Bascom is the richest
man in the parish, and his influence is strong. You
will find that everyone defers to his judgment as a
matter of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; then let me add, for your own information,
that I can earn my living honestly in this town
and take care of myself without Mr. Bascom&#8217;s assistance,
if necessary; and do my parish work at the same
time. I have two muscular arms, and if it comes down
to earning a livelihood, independent of my salary, I
can work on the state road hauling stone. Williamson
told me yesterday he was looking for men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can scarcely think that the parishioners would
hold with their rector working like a common laborer,
Mr. Maxwell,&#8221; admonished Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all &#8216;common,&#8217; in the right sense, Mr.
Nelson. My view is that work of any kind is always
honorable when necessary, except in the eyes of the
ignorant. If Mr. Bascom is mortified to have me
earn my living by manual labor, when he is not
ashamed to repudiate a contract, and try to force me
out of the parish by a process of slow starvation,
his sense of fitness equals his standard of honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am sure that I do not know what I can
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to tell you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it will relieve your feelings,&#8221; Nelson drawled
insolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then get out of this place and stay out. If you
return again for any purpose whatever I am afraid it
is I who will have to eject you. We will not argue
the matter again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I regret this unfortunate encounter, and to
have been forced to listen to the unguarded vituperation
of my rector.&#8221; With which retort he departed.</p>
<p>Soon after Nelson had left, Mrs. Burke called in,
and Betty gave her a highly amusing and somewhat
colored version of the interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I think that our theological seminaries
don&#8217;t teach budding parsons all they ought to, by any
means,&#8221; she concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you, Betty dear; and I thank
my stars for college athletics,&#8221; laughed Maxwell,
squaring up to the tent-pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you,&#8221; reminded Hepsey, &#8220;when
you had all those books up in your room at my place.
It&#8217;s just as important for a country parson to know
how to make a wiped-joint or run a chicken farm or
pull teeth, as it is to study church history and theology.
A parson&#8217;s got to live somehow, and a trade
school ought to be attached to every seminary, according
to my way of thinking! St. Paul made tents,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
and wasn&#8217;t a bit ashamed of it. Well I&#8217;m mighty glad
that Bascom has got come up with for once. Don&#8217;t
you give in, and it will be my turn to make the next
move, if this don&#8217;t bring him to his senses. You
just wait and see.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>COULEUR de ROSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Hepsey had been so busy with helping the
Maxwells that for some time no opportunity
had occurred for Jonathan to press his ardent
suit. Since his first attempt and its abrupt termination,
he had been somewhat bewildered; he
had failed to decide whether he was an engaged man
open to congratulations, or a rejected suitor to be
condoled with. He tried to recall exactly what she
had said. As near as he could recollect, it was: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
think it over, and perhaps some day&mdash;&#8221; Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
had committed the indiscretion of grasping her hand,
causing her to drop her stitches before she had ended
what she was going to say. He could have sworn at
himself to think that it was all his fault that she had
stopped just at the critical moment, when she might
have committed herself and given him some real encouragement.
But he consoled himself by the thought
that she had evidently taken him seriously at last; and
so to the &#8220;perhaps some day&#8221; he added, in imagination,
the words &#8220;I will take you&#8221;; and this seemed
reasonable.</p>
<p>The matter was more difficult from the very fact
that they had been on such intimate terms for such
a long time, and she had never hitherto given him
any reason to think that she cared for him other than
as a good neighbor and a friend. Ever since the death
of his wife, she seemed to feel that he had been left
an orphan in a cold and unsympathetic world, and
that it was her duty to look after him much as she
would a child. She was in the habit of walking over
whenever she pleased and giving directions to Mary
McGuire in regard to matters which she thought
needed attention in his house. And all this had been
done in the most open and matter-of-fact way, so that
the most accomplished gossip in Durford never accused
her of making matrimonial advances to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
lonesome widower. Even Jonathan himself had been
clever enough to see that she regarded him much as
she would an overgrown boy, and had always accepted
her many attentions without misinterpreting them.
She was a born manager, and she managed him; that
was all. Nothing could be more unsentimental than
the way in which she would make him take off his
coat during a friendly call, and let her sponge and
press it for him; or the imperative fashion in which
she sent him to the barber&#8217;s to have his beard trimmed.
How could a man make love to a woman after she
had acted like this?</p>
<p>But he reminded himself that if he was ever to
win her he must begin to carry out the advice outlined
by Mrs. Betty; and so the apparently unsuspecting
Hepsey would find on her side porch in the morning
some specially fine corn which had been placed there
after dark without the name of the donor. Once a
fine melon was accompanied by a bottle of perfumery;
and again a basket of peaches had secreted in
its center a package of toilet soap &#8220;strong enough to
kill the grass,&#8221; as Hepsey remarked as she sniffed at
it. Finally matters reached a climax when a bushel
of potatoes arrived on the scene in the early dawn,
and with it a canary bird in a tin cage. When Hepsey
saw Jonathan later, she remarked casually that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
she &#8220;guessed she&#8217;d keep the potatoes; but she didn&#8217;t
need a canary bird any more than a turtle needs a
tooth-pick; and he had better take it away and get
his money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Jonathan never allowed her occasional
rebuffs to discourage him or stop his attentions. He
kept a close watch on all Hepsey&#8217;s domestic interests,
and if there were any small repairs to be made at
Thunder Cliff, a hole in the roof to be mended, or
the bricks on the top of the chimney to be relaid,
or the conductor pipe to be readjusted, Jonathan was
on the spot. Then Jonathan would receive in return
a layer cake with chopped walnuts in the filling, and
would accept it in the same matter-of-fact way in
which Hepsey permitted his services as general caretaker.</p>
<p>This give-and-take business went on for some time.
At last it occurred to him that Mrs. Burke&#8217;s front
porch ought to be painted, and he conceived the notion
of doing the work without her knowledge, as a pleasant
surprise to her. He waited a long time for some
day when she should be going over to shop at Martin&#8217;s
Junction,&mdash;when Nickey usually managed to be
taken along,&mdash;so that he could do the work unobserved.
Meantime, he collected from the hardware
store various cards with samples of different colors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
on them. These he would combine and re-combine
at his leisure, in the effort to decide just what colors
would harmonize. He finally decided that a rather
dark blue for the body work would go quite well,
with a bright magenta for the trimmings, and laid in
a stock of paint and brushes, and possessed his soul
in patience.</p>
<p>So one afternoon, arriving home burdened with
the spoils of Martin&#8217;s Junction, great was Mrs.
Burke&#8217;s astonishment and wrath when she discovered
the porch resplendent in dark blue and magenta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive! Have I got to live inside of that,&#8221;
she snorted. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the worst lookin&#8217; thing I
ever saw. If I don&#8217;t settle <i>him</i>,&#8221; she added, &#8220;&mdash;paintin&#8217;
my porch as if it belonged to him&mdash;and
me as well,&#8221; she added ambiguously. And, catching
up her sun-bonnet, she hastened over to her neighbor&#8217;s
and inquired for Jonathan. &#8220;Sure, he&#8217;s gone to
Martin&#8217;s Junction to see his brother, Mrs. Burke.
He said he&#8217;d stay over night, and I needn&#8217;t come in
again till to-morrow dinner-time,&#8221; Mary McGuire
replied.</p>
<p>Hepsey hastened home, and gathering all the rags
she could find, she summoned Nickey and Mullen, one
of the men from the farm, and they worked with
turpentine for nearly two hours, cleaning off the fresh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
paint from the porch. Then she sent Nickey down
to the hardware store for some light gray paint and
some vivid scarlet paint, and a bit of dryer. It did
not take very long to repaint her porch gray&mdash;every
trace of the blue and the magenta having been removed
by the vigorous efforts of the three.</p>
<p>When it was finished, she opened the can of scarlet,
and pouring in a large quantity of dryer she sent
Nickey over to see if Mary McGuire had gone home.
All three set to work that evening to paint the porch
in front of Jonathan&#8217;s house. At first Mullen protested
anxiously that it was none of his business to
be painting another man&#8217;s porch, but Mrs. Burke
gave him a look which changed his convictions; so
he and Nickey proceeded gleefully to fulfill their appointed
task, while she got supper.</p>
<p>When the work was quite finished. Hepsey went
over to inspect it, and remarked thoughtfully to herself:
&#8220;I should think that a half pint of dryer might
be able to get in considerable work before to-morrow
noon. I hope Jonathan&#8217;ll like scarlet. To be sure
it does look rather strikin&#8217; on a white house; but then
variety helps to relieve the monotony of a dead alive
town like Durford; and if he don&#8217;t like it plain, he
can trim it green. I&#8217;ll teach him to come paintin&#8217; my
house without so much as a by-your-leave, or with-your-leave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
lettin&#8217; the whole place think things.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happened, Jonathan returned late that night
to Durford&mdash;quite too late to see the transformation
of his own front porch, and since he entered by the
side door as usual, he did not even smell the new
paint. The next morning he sauntered over to Thunder
Cliff, all agog for his reward, and Mrs. Burke
greeted him at her side door, smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good mornin&#8217;, Jonathan. It was awful good of
you to paint my front porch. It <i>has</i> needed paintin&#8217;
for some time now, but I never seemed to get around
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, Hepsey,&#8221; Jonathan replied affably.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. You&#8217;re always doin&#8217; somethin&#8217;
for me, and it&#8217;s a pity if I can&#8217;t do a little thing
like that for you once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey had strolled round to the front, as if to
admire his work, Jonathan following. Suddenly he
came to a halt; his jaw dropped, and he stared as if
he had gone out of his senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a lovely color; gray just suits the house, you
know,&#8221; Mrs. Burke observed. &#8220;You certainly ought
to have been an artist, Jonathan. Any man with such
an eye for color ought not to be wastin&#8217; his time on a
farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan still gazed at the porch in amazement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
blinked hard, wiped his eyes and his glasses with his
handkerchief, and looked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Have you a headache?&#8221;
Hepsey inquired solicitously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t got no headache; but when I left
that porch yesterday noon it was blue, and now I&#8217;m
blamed if it don&#8217;t seem gray. Does it look gray-like
to you, Hepsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why certainly! What&#8217;s that you say? Do you
say you painted it blue? That certainly&#8217;s mighty
queer. But then you know some kinds of paint fade&mdash;some
kinds do!&#8221; She nodded, looking suspiciously
at the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fade!&#8221; Jonathan sneered. &#8220;Paints don&#8217;t fade by
moonlight in one night. That isn&#8217;t no faded blue.
It&#8217;s just plain gray. I must be goin&#8217; color blind, or
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks gray to me, and I&#8217;m glad it is gray, so
don&#8217;t you worry about it, Jonathan. Blue would be
somethin&#8217; awful on the front of a white house, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the bewildered Junior Warden,
&#8220;I&#8217;m blessed if this isn&#8217;t the queerest thing I ever see
in all my born days. If I catch the fellow that sold
me that paint, I&#8217;ll make it lively for him or my name
isn&#8217;t Jackson.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t do anything like that! What difference
does it make, so long as I like the color myself;
it&#8217;s my house. I should have been very much
put out if you&#8217;d painted it blue; yes, I should.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like to be cheated down at the store;
and I won&#8217;t, by gum! They said it was best quality
paint! I&#8217;ll go down to Crosscut&#8217;s and see about this
business, right now. I&#8217;ve traded with him nigh on
twenty years, and he don&#8217;t bamboozle me that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey turned away choking with laughter, and
retreated to her kitchen.</p>
<p>Jonathan started back towards his house to get his
hat and coat, and then for the first time he caught
sight of his own porch, done in flaming scarlet, which
fairly seemed to radiate heat in the brilliant sunlight.
He stood motionless for nearly a minute, paralyzed.
Then the color began to rise in his neck and face as
he muttered under his breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! I&#8217;m on to the whole business now. I ought
to have known that Hepsey would get the best of
me. I guess I won&#8217;t go down to Crosscut&#8217;s after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he walked up to the porch and touched the
scarlet paint with his finger and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Set harder than a rock, by gum! She must have
used a whole lot of dryer. I&#8217;ll get even with her for
this. See if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>In the afternoon Jonathan brought over some fine
apples and presented them to Hepsey, who was knitting
on her side porch. She thanked him for the gift,
and the conversation drifted from one thing to another
while she waited for the expected outburst of
reproach which she knew would come sooner or later.
But curiously enough, Jonathan was more cheery and
cordial than usual, and made no allusion whatever to
the scarlet porch, which was conspicuously visible
from where they sat. Again and again Hepsey led
the conversation around to the point where it seemed
as if he must break covert, but he remained oblivious,
and changed the subject readily. Not a word on the
subject passed his lips that afternoon.</p>
<p>Then, from day to day the neighbors called and
inquired of her if Jackson had gone off his head, or
what was the matter. His flaming porch outraged
Durford&#8217;s sense of decency. She was at her wits end
to answer, without actually lying or compromising
herself; so the only thing she said was that she had
noticed that he had been acting a bit peculiar lately,
now they mentioned it. As time went on, the scarlet
porch became the talk of the town. It was duly discussed
at the sewing society, and the reading club,
and the general sentiment was practically unanimous
that Jackson must be suffering from incipient cataract
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
or senile dementia, and needed a guardian. Even
Mary McGuire remarked to Mrs. Burke that she was
afraid &#8220;that there front porch would sure set the
house on fire, if it wasn&#8217;t put out before.&#8221; Everybody
agreed that if his wife had lived, the thing
never could have happened.</p>
<p>Meantime, Jonathan went about his daily business,
serene and happy, apparently oblivious of the fact
that there was anything unusual in the decoration of
his house. When his friends began to chaff him about
the porch he seemed surprised, and guessed it was
his privilege to paint his house any color he had a
mind to, and there was no law ag&#8217;in&#8217; it; it was nobody&#8217;s
business but his own. Tastes in color differed,
and there was no reason in the world why
all houses should be painted alike. He liked variety
himself, and nobody could say that scarlet wasn&#8217;t a
real cheerful color on a white house.</p>
<p>Occasionally people who were driving by stopped
to contemplate the porch; and the Durford Daily
<i>Bugle</i> devoted a long facetious paragraph to the matter.
All of which Mrs. Burke knew very well, and it
was having its effect on her nerves. The porch was
the most conspicuous object in view from Hepsey&#8217;s
sitting-room windows, and every time she entered the
room she found herself looking at the flaming terror
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
with increasing exasperation. Verily, if Jonathan
wanted revenge he was getting far more than he
knew: the biter was badly bit. The matter came to
a crisis one day, when Jonathan concluded a discussion
with Mrs. Burke about the pasture fence. She
burst out abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jonathan Jackson, why in the name of conscience
don&#8217;t you paint your porch a Christian color?
It&#8217;s simply awful, and I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to sit in my
house and have to look at it all winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan did not seem greatly stirred, and replied
in an absent-minded way:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you move your sittin&#8217; room over to
the other side of the house, Hepsey? Then you
wouldn&#8217;t have to see it. Don&#8217;t you like scarlet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t like it, and if you don&#8217;t paint it out,
I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; rash, Hepsey. You know sometimes
colors fade in the moonlight&mdash;some colors, that
is. Maybe that scarlet porch&#8217;ll turn to a light gray
if you let it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke could stand it no longer; so, laying
down her work she exploded her pent-up wrath:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan Jackson, if that paint isn&#8217;t gone before
to-morrow, I&#8217;ll come over and paint it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t necessary, Hepsey. And it might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
set people talkin&#8217;. But if you won&#8217;t move your sittin&#8217;-room
to the other side of your own house, why don&#8217;t
you move it over to my house? You wouldn&#8217;t see so
much of the red paint then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey snorted and spluttered in baffled rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, Hepsey,&#8221; soothed Jonathan, &#8220;if that
don&#8217;t suit you, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do: I&#8217;ll paint it
over myself on one condition!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;ll marry me,&#8221; snapped Jonathan hungrily.</p>
<p>Instead of resenting such bold tactics on the part
of her suitor, Mrs. Burke gazed at him a long time
with a rather discouraged look on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; she exclaimed at last with assumed
weariness and a whimsical smile, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I&#8217;d
ever come to this; but I guess I&#8217;ll have to marry you
to keep you from makin&#8217; another kind of fool of yourself;
widowers are such helpless mortals, and you certainly
do need a guardian.&#8221; She shook her head at
him despondently.</p>
<p>Jonathan advanced towards her deliberately, and
clinched the matter:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Hepsey, seein&#8217; that we&#8217;re engaged&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Engaged? What do you mean? Get away,
you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; She rose from her chair in a hurry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now Hepsey, a bargain&#8217;s a bargain: you just said
you&#8217;d have to marry me, and I guess the sooner you
do it and have it over with, the better. So, seein&#8217;
that we are engaged to be married, as I was about to
remark when you interrupted me....&#8221; Relentlessly
he approached her once more. She retreated a step
or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Sakes alive, Jonathan! Whatever&#8217;s come
over you to make you so masterful. Well, yes then&mdash;I
suppose a bargain&#8217;s a bargain, all right. But before
your side of it&#8217;s paid up you&#8217;ve got to go right
over and paint that porch of yours a respectable
color.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, for once, Hepsey&#8217;s strategy had been manipulated
to her own defeat: Jonathan went off to town
with flying colors, and bought himself a can of pure
white paint.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was eleven o&#8217;clock at night. Mrs. Betty had
retired, while her husband was still struggling
to finish a sermon on the importance of foreign
missions. Ordinarily, the work would have been congenial
and easy for him, because he was an enthusiast
in the matter of missionary work: but now for some
reason his thoughts were confused; his enthusiasm
was lacking, and his pen dragged. He tried hard to
pull himself together, but over and over again the
question kept repeating itself in his tired brain: Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
should the Church support foreign missions, while
she lets her hard working clergy at home suffer and
half starve in their old age, and even fails to give
them decent support while they are working in their
prime? Why should a doctor reach his highest professional
value at seventy, and a parson be past the
&#8220;dead-line&#8221; at forty-five? Here he was, subject to
the caprice and ill-will of a sour and miserly Senior
Warden, and a cowed and at least partially &#8220;bossed&#8221;
vestry&mdash;and he, the rector, with no practical power
of appeal for the enforcement of his legal contract.
It was only thanks to Jonathan Jackson, the Junior
Warden, that any revenue at all reached him; for
Bascom had used every grain of influence he possessed
to reduce or stop Maxwell&#8217;s salary. Mrs. Betty,
plucky and cheery though she was, already showed
the results of the weary struggle: it was not the work
that took the color from her cheeks and the freshness
from her face, but the worry incidental to causes
which, in any other calling in life but his, would be
removable.</p>
<p>Already he had parted with a considerable number
of his books to eke out, and meet the many calls upon
him&mdash;urgent and insistent calls. It became abundantly
clear, as his mind strayed from the manuscript
before him and turned to their immediate situation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
that he was already forced to choose between two
alternatives: either he must give up, and own himself
and all the better influences in the place beaten by
Bascom and his satellites; or he must find some means
of augmenting his means of living, without allowing
his time and energy to be monopolized to the neglect
of essential parish and church duties.</p>
<p>As he thought on these things, somehow his enthusiasm
for foreign missions ebbed away, and left
him desperately tired and worried. He made several
abortive attempts to put some fire into his missionary
plea, but it was useless; and he was about to give
up when he heard Mrs. Betty&#8217;s gentle voice inquiring
from the next room:</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in? Haven&#8217;t you finished that wretched
old missionary sermon yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear; but why aren&#8217;t you asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been anxious about you. You are worn
out and you need your rest. Now just let the heathen
rage, and go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell made no reply, but picked at his manuscript
aimlessly with his pen. Betty looked into his
face, and then the whole stress of the situation
pierced her; and sitting down by his side she dropped
her head on his shoulder and with one arm around
his neck stroked his cheek with her fingers. For a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
moments neither of them spoke; and then Maxwell
said quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty, love, I am going to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Donny, you are one of the hardest working
men in this town. What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean that I am going to find secular work,
the work of a day laborer, if necessary. Matters
have come to a crisis, and I simply cannot stand this
sort of thing any longer. If I were alone I might
get along; but I have you, sweetheart, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell stopped suddenly, and the brave little woman
at his side said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all about it, Donald, and I think you
are fully justified in doing anything you think best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t feel ashamed of me if I handled
a shovel or dug in the street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be the proudest woman in the town, Donny;
you are just your fine dear self, whatever you do; and
if you have the courage to put your pride in your
pocket and work in overalls, that would make you all
the finer to me. Manual work would relieve the tension
of your nerves. You seem to be in fairly good
physical condition. Don&#8217;t you worry one bit about
me. I am going to wash some lace curtains for Mrs.
Roscoe-Jones, and that will keep me out of mischief.
Now, if you will allow me, I am going to tear up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
that sermon on foreign missions, and start a little
home mission of my own by sending you to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second morning after this ruthless destruction
of Maxwell&#8217;s eloquent plea for the mission at Bankolulu,
Danny Dolan drove up to the tent-rectory at
half-past six, and Maxwell emerged and jumped up
by Danny&#8217;s side, dressed in a rather soiled suit of
overalls: Danny was a teamster, a good looking
youth, and a devoted friend of Maxwell&#8217;s since the
parson had taken care of him and his family through
an attack of malignant diphtheria. But while Danny
was a most loyal friend, he was not of the emotional
type, and so, when Maxwell had seated himself comfortably
and had lighted his briar pipe, Danny started
down the road at a vigorous pace, grinning broadly
at Maxwell&#8217;s attire as he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re really goin&#8217; to work like the rest of us,
I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Danny&mdash;four days a week, anyhow.
Don&#8217;t I look like the real thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you do; only you better not shave every day,
and you&#8217;ll have to get your hands dirty before you
can fool anybody, and maybe your face&#8217;ll give you
away even then. Be you comfortable in them clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing; I&#8217;m never so contented as I am in
working clothes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;re the stuff. But how
about the proper old maids in the parish who ogle
and dance around you; they won&#8217;t cotton to your
clothes a little bit. They&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re degradin&#8217; of
yourself and disgracin&#8217; of the parish. Here you be
ridin&#8217; on a stone wagon, and you don&#8217;t look a bit
better than me, if I do say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll have to survive the shock somehow
or other; a man has to dress according to his
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Now there&#8217;s that there Mrs. Roscoe-Jones
and Miss Bascom; I&#8217;ll bet if they saw you in that rig
they&#8217;d throw a fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no; it isn&#8217;t as bad as that, Danny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d think you&#8217;d been disgraced for life, to become
a laborin&#8217; man, you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A laborin&#8217; man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think that a parson doesn&#8217;t labor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I always thought that bein&#8217; a parson was a
dead easy job, and a nice clean job too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danny,&#8221; Maxwell inquired after a momentary
silence, &#8220;don&#8217;t you suppose that a man labors with his
brain as well as with his muscles? And sometimes a
parson labors with his heart, and that is the hardest
kind of work a man ever does. The man who is most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
of a laboring man is the man who labors with every
power and faculty he possesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I guess that may be right, if you look
at it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you speak of a laboring man, and you mean
a man who uses his muscles and lets his brain and his
feelings die of starvation. To try to help some one
you&#8217;re fond of, who is going to the bad, is the most
nerve-racking and exhausting work which any man
can possibly do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! you always was a dum queer parson, more
like the rest of us, somehow. And you don&#8217;t hold
that you&#8217;re disgracin&#8217; your profession ridin&#8217; with me,
and shovelin&#8217; gravel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to be worrying much about it, do I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he agreed&mdash;and added, &#8220;and I&#8217;m dum sure
I would like a day off now and then from preachin&#8217;
and callin&#8217; on old maids, if I was you. But there&#8217;s
times I might be willin&#8217; for to let you take my work
for yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, if you&#8217;ll do my work for a few
days, I&#8217;ll do yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;d I have to do? I &#8217;aint makin&#8217; any
contract without specifications.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suppose we say you do my work Saturday
and Sunday. That means you finish up two sermons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
which must be original and interesting when you are
preaching to the same set of people about a hundred
and fifty times a year. Then you must go and see a
woman who is always complaining, and listen to her
woes for three-quarters of an hour. Then you must
go and see what you can do for Tom Bradsaw, who
is dying of tuberculosis. Then you must conduct a
choir rehearsal&mdash;not always the highest gratification
of a musical ear. Sunday, you must conduct four services
and try to rouse a handful of people, who stare
at you from the back pews, to some higher ideals of
life and common decency, Then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, heavens, man! Sure, an&#8217; that&#8217;s enough; I
stick to the stone wagon every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be a fool if you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Maxwell
straightly. &#8220;Then again you get your pay promptly
every Saturday night. I never know when I am going
to get mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t? Begad, and I wouldn&#8217;t work for anybody
if I wasn&#8217;t paid prompt. I&#8217;d sue the Bishop or
the Pope, or somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Parsons don&#8217;t sue: it&#8217;s considered improper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; muttered the astonished Danny.
&#8220;Be you sure you can shovel stone then?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>Maxwell unbuttoned his wristband, rolled up his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
sleeve. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll know the reason why,&#8221; he
remarked tersely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff,&#8221; laughed Danny, looking at Maxwell&#8217;s
muscle. &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t want to meet you out
walkin&#8217; after dark without a gun. But say, why don&#8217;t
you swat the Bishop one, and get your pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bishop isn&#8217;t responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll bet I know who is, dang him; and I&#8217;d
like to swat him one for you, the miserable old bag-of-bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind, Danny; I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you can, and I guess you&#8217;re a laborin&#8217; man
all right, even if you don&#8217;t belong to the Union. Why
don&#8217;t you get up a parson&#8217;s Union and go on strike?
By Jove! I would. Let your parish go to&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danny, don&#8217;t you think it looks like rain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, neither do you; but here we are at the stone
pile. My! but how the fellers will grin when they
see a tenderfoot like you, and a parson at that,
shovelin&#8217; stone. But they won&#8217;t think any the less of
you for it, mind you,&#8221; he reassured his companion.</p>
<p>Maxwell knew most of the men, and greeted them
by name, and when he rolled up his sleeves and began
work, they quickly saw that he was &#8220;no slouch,&#8221; and
that he did not &#8220;soldier,&#8221; or shirk, as many of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
did&mdash;though sometimes they were inclined to rest on
their shovels and chaff him good-naturedly, and ask
him if he had his Union card with him.</p>
<p>Shoveling stone is no picnic, as Danny and his fellows
would have put it. It is not only the hard, obstructed
thrust, thrust of the shovel into the heap of
broken stone, and the constant lift and swing of each
shovelful into the wagon; it is the slow monotony of
repetition of unvarying motion that becomes most irksome
to the tyro, and wears down the nervous system
of the old hand till his whole being is leveled to the
insensibility of a soulless machine.</p>
<p>But, though new to the process itself, Maxwell was
not ignorant of its effects; and soon he found himself
distracting his attention from the strain of the muscular
tension by fitting the action to the rhythm of
some old sailor&#8217;s chanteys he had learned at college.
The effect amused the men; and then as some of them
caught the beat, and others joined in, soon the whole
gang was ringing the changes on the simple airs, and
found it a rousing and cheerful diversion from the
monotony of labor.</p>
<p>If a pause came, soon one of them would call out:
&#8220;Come on, Parson; strike up the hymn.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one the wagons were loaded, and driven to
the road. After they had filled the last wagon, Danny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
put on his coat, and he and Maxwell mounted and
drove out of the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going with this?&#8221; Maxwell inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down on the state road, first turn to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that must be near Willow Bluff, Mr. Bascom&#8217;s
place, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right opposite. Bascom, he come out yesterday,
and said he wouldn&#8217;t stand for that steam roller snortin&#8217;
back and forth in front of his house. But Jim
Ferris told him he had his orders from Williamson,
and he wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be held up by nobody until
Williamson told him to stop. Jim isn&#8217;t any kind of
fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they arrived in front of Willow Bluff, they
stopped, dismounted, and dumped the crushed stone,
and then returned to the stone yard. At noon they
camped out on the curb in front of Willow Bluff.
After Maxwell had done full justice to the contents
of his dinner pail, he stretched himself full length on
the grass for a few moments, chatting with his mates
in friendly fashion. Then he went over to the roller
and assisted the engineer in &#8220;oiling up.&#8221; Being a
novice at the business, he managed to get his hands
black with oil, and smeared a streak across one cheek,
which, while it helped to obscure his identity, did not
add to his facial beauty. He was blissfully unconscious
of this. About three o&#8217;clock Bascom returned
from his office, just as Maxwell was dismounting
from the wagon after bringing a load. At first Bascom
did not recognize the rector, but a second glance
brought the awful truth home to his subliminal self,
and he stopped and stared at Maxwell, stricken dumb.
Maxwell politely touched his hat, and smilingly remarked
that it was a fine day. Bascom made no reply
at first.</p>

&#8220;I CONSIDER IT A SHAME AND A DISGRACE TO THE PARISH TO HAVE OUR RECTOR IN FILTHY CLOTHES, DRAWING STONE WITH A LOT OF RUFFIANS&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can it be possible that this is you, Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;
he almost whispered, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, to the best of my knowledge and belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the name of heaven are you working with
these men for, if I may ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To earn sufficient money to pay my grocer&#8217;s bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bascom colored hotly, and sputtered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider it a shame and a disgrace to the parish
to have our rector in filthy clothes, drawing stone
with a lot of ruffians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell colored as hotly, and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not ruffians, sir; they are honest men,
supporting their families in a perfectly legitimate way,
giving their labor and&#8221;&mdash;significantly&mdash;&#8220;receiving
their pay for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you, sir, are engaged to work for the parish,
as a minister of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I am not being paid by the parish;
that is why I am working here. Neither my wife nor
myself is going to starve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any pride, sir!&#8221; Bascom fumed, his
temper out of control. &#8220;We have had many incompetent
rectors, but this really surpasses anything. We
have never had anyone like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell paused again in his work, and, leaning on
his shovel, looked Bascom in the eye:</p>
<p>&#8220;By which you mean that you have never had anyone
who was independent enough to grip the situation
in both hands and do exactly what he thought
best, independent of your dictation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not converse with you any more. You are
insulting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the corporation is paying me for my time, I
prefer work to conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bascom strode along the road towards his home.
Danny Dolan, who had been a shameless auditor of
this conversation, from the other side of the wagon,
was beside himself with delight:</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy Moses! but didn&#8217;t you give it to the old
man. And here be all your adorers from town after
comin&#8217; to tea at the house, and you lookin&#8217; like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
stoker of an engine with black grease half an inch
thick on your cheek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell pulled out his handkerchief, and made
an abortive effort to get his face clean.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it now, Danny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it &#8217;aint nearly as thick in any one place; it&#8217;s
mostly all over your face now.&#8221; Then Danny laughed
irreverently again. &#8220;Sure, an&#8217; you certainly do look
like the real thing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell was raking gravel when the guests for
the afternoon tea were passing; and though he did
not look up, he fully realized that they had recognized
him, from the buzz of talk and the turning of
heads.</p>
<p>Danny returned from his safer distance when he
saw the coast was clear. Maxwell had a shrewd suspicion
that the boy had taken himself off believing it
might embarrass Maxwell less if any of the ladies
should speak to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did none of &#8217;em know you, then?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one of them spoke; I guess my disguise is
pretty complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank hiven!&#8221; Danny exclaimed. &#8220;Then the
crisis is passed for to-day at least, and your reputation
is saved; but if you don&#8217;t get out of this they&#8217;ll
be comin&#8217; out again, and then nobody knows what&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
happen. Better smear some more oil over the other
cheek to cover the last bit of dacency left in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day&#8217;s work, Maxwell threw his
shovel into Dolan&#8217;s wagon and jumped up on the seat
with him and drove back to town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Maxwell&#8217;s friend, delightedly, &#8220;you
done a mighty good day&#8217;s work for a tenderfoot; but
you done more with that old Bascom than in all the
rest of the day put together. My! but I thought I&#8217;d
split my sides to see you puttin&#8217; him where he belonged,
and you lookin&#8217; like a coal heaver. But it&#8217;s
a howlin&#8217; shame you didn&#8217;t speak to them women,
goin&#8217; all rigged up for the party. That would&#8217;ve been
the finishin&#8217; touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swayed about on his seat, laughing heartily,
until they drew up before the rectory, where Mrs.
Betty was waiting to greet Maxwell.</p>
<p>Danny touched his cap shyly&mdash;but Betty came down
to the wagon and gave him a cheery greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you&#8217;ve brought him back alive, Mr. Dolan,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am! And I reckon he&#8217;ll keep you busy
puttin&#8217; the food to him, if he eats like he works: he&#8217;s
a glutton for work, is Mr. Maxwell.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>UNINVITED GUESTS</h3>
</div>
<p>A few nights later, when Maxwell returned
from his work he found Mrs. Burke sitting
on the front platform of the tent with Mrs.
Betty; and having washed, and changed his clothes,
he persuaded their visitor to stay to supper. After
supper was over they sat out doors, chatting of Maxwell&#8217;s
amusing experiences.</p>
<p>They had not been sitting long when their attention
was attracted by a noise up the street, and going
to the fence they saw a horse, over which the driver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
evidently had lost control, galloping towards them,
with a buggy which was swerving from side to side
under the momentum of its terrific speed.</p>
<p>Maxwell rushed into the middle of the street to
see if he could be of any assistance in stopping the
horse and preventing a catastrophe; but before he
could get near enough to be of any service the animal
suddenly shied, the buggy gave a final lurch, overturned,
and was thrown violently against a telegraph
pole. The horse, freed, dashed on, dragging the
shafts and part of the harness. The occupant of the
buggy had been thrown out against the telegraph pole
with considerable force, knocked senseless, and lay
in the gutter, stained with blood and dirt. Mrs.
Burke and Betty lifted the body of the buggy, while
Maxwell pulled out from under it the senseless form
of a man; and when they had turned him over and
wiped the blood from his face, they discovered, to
their utter amazement, that the victim was no less a
personage than the Senior Warden, Sylvester Bascom.</p>
<p>Of course there was nothing to be done but to carry
him as best they could into the tent, and lay him on
a lounge. Maxwell ran hastily for a doctor, while
Hepsey and Mrs. Betty applied restoratives, washed
the face of the injured man, and bound up as best
they could what appeared to be a serious wound on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
one wrist, and another on the side of his head. The
doctor responded promptly, and after a thorough examination
announced that Bascom was seriously hurt,
and that at present it would be dangerous to remove
him. So Mrs. Betty and her guest removed Maxwell&#8217;s
personal belongings, and improvised a bed in
the front room of the tent, into which Bascom was
lifted with the greatest care. Having done what he
could, the doctor departed, promising to return soon.
In about twenty minutes there were signs of returning
consciousness, and for some time Bascom looked
about him in a dazed way, and groaned with pain.
Mrs. Burke decided at once to remain all night with
Mrs. Betty, and assist in caring for the warden until
Virginia could arrive and assume charge of the case.
After about an hour, Bascom seemed to be fully conscious
as he gazed from one face to another, and
looked wonderingly at the canvas tent in which he
found himself. Mrs. Burke bent over him and inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in much pain, Mr. Bascom?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment or two the Senior Warden made no
answer; then in a hoarse whisper he inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I? What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, something frightened your horse,
and your buggy was overturned, and you were thrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
against a telegraph pole and injured more or less.
We picked you up and brought you in here, cleaned
you up, and tried to make you as comfortable as possible.
The doctor has been here and looked you over,
and will return in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I seriously injured?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have two bad wounds, and have evidently
lost a good deal of blood; but don&#8217;t worry. Mrs.
Betty and I and the rest of us will take good care of
you and do all we can until Virginia is able to take
you home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>A curious expression of mild triumph and amusement
played across Mrs. Burke&#8217;s face as she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in Donald Maxwell&#8217;s tent. This was the
nearest place where we could bring you at the time
of the accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment a vestige of color appeared in Bascom&#8217;s
face, and he whispered hoarsely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you take me home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we were afraid to move you until the doctor
had examined you thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patient closed his eyes wearily.</p>
<p>It was evident that he was growing weaker, and
just as the doctor returned, he again lapsed into unconsciousness.
The doctor felt of Bascom&#8217;s pulse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and sent Maxwell hastily for Doctor Field for consultation.
For fifteen minutes the doctors were alone
in Bascom&#8217;s room, and then Doctor Field called Maxwell
in and quietly informed him that the warden had
lost so much blood from the wound in the wrist that
there was danger of immediate collapse unless they
resorted to extreme measures, and bled some one to
supply the patient. To this Maxwell instantly replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am strong and well. There is no reason why
you should hesitate for a moment. Send for your
instruments at once; but my wife must know nothing
of it until it is all over with. Tell Mrs. Burke to
take her over to Thunder Cliff for an hour or two,
on the pretext of getting some bedding. Yes, I insist
on having my own way, and as you say, there is no
time to be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Field took Mrs. Burke aside, and the women
immediately departed for Thunder Cliff. The
necessary instruments were brought, and then the
three men entered the sick room.</p>
<p>In about twenty minutes Maxwell came out of the
invalid&#8217;s room, assisted by Doctor Field, and
stretched himself on the bed.</p>
<p>Bascom&#8217;s color began slowly to return; his pulse
quickened, and Dr. Field remarked to his colleague:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think the old chap is going to pull through
after all; but it was a mighty close squeak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the messenger who had been sent out
to Willow Bluff to apprise Virginia of her father&#8217;s
accident returned with the information that Virginia
had left the day before, to stay with friends, and
could not possibly get home till next day. It was decided
to telegraph for her; and in the meantime the
doctors advised that Mr. Bascom be left quietly in
his bed at the new &#8220;rectory,&#8221; and be moved home
next day, after having recovered some of his lost
strength. Mrs. Betty and Mrs. Burke took turns in
watching by the invalid that night, and it might have
been observed that his eyes remained closed, even
when he did not sleep, while Mrs. Burke was in attendance,
but that he watched Mrs. Betty with keen
curiosity and wonder, from between half-closed lids,
as she sat at the foot of his bed sewing, or moved
about noiselessly preparing the nourishment prescribed
for him by the doctors, and which the old
gentleman took from her with unusual gentleness and
patience.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Burke who, having learned of the time
when Virginia was expected to return home, drove
out to Willow Bluff with Mr. Bascom, and assisted
in making him comfortable there before his daughter&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
arrival. He volunteered no word on their way
thither, but lay back among his cushions and pillows
with closed eyes, pale and exhausted&mdash;though the doctors
assured the Maxwells that there was no cause
for anxiety on the score of his removal, when they
urged that he be left in their care until he had regained
more strength.</p>
<p>It was a white and scared Virginia who listened to
Hepsey&#8217;s account of all that had happened&mdash;an account
which neither over-stated the Bascoms&#8217; debt to
the Maxwells nor spared Virginia&#8217;s guilty conscience.</p>
<p>When she found that her father had been the guest
of the Maxwells and that they had played the part
of good Samaritans to him in the tent in which the
Senior Warden had obliged them to take refuge, she
was thoroughly mortified, and there was a struggle
between false pride and proper gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very awkward, is it not, Mrs. Burke?&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I ought certainly to call on Mrs. Maxwell and
thank her&mdash;but&mdash;under the circumstances&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What circumstances?&#8221; asked Hepsey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, it will be very embarrassing for
me to go to Mr. Maxwell&#8217;s tent after what has happened
between him and&mdash;my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I catch on, Virginia. Which
happenin&#8217; do you mean? Your father&#8217;s cold-blooded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
ejection of the Maxwells from their house, or Mr.
Maxwell&#8217;s warm-blooded sacrifice to save your father&#8217;s
life? Perhaps it <i>is</i> a bit embarrassing, as you
call it, to thank a man for givin&#8217; his blood to save
your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a more personal matter than that,&#8221; replied
Virginia, gazing dramatically out of the window.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t quite seem to appreciate the delicacy of
the situation, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m blessed if I do. But then you know I&#8217;m
very stupid about some things, Virginia. Fact is,
I&#8217;m just stupid enough to imagine&mdash;no, I mean think&mdash;that
it would be the most natural thing in the world
to go straight to the Maxwells and thank &#8217;em for all
they&#8217;ve done for your father in takin&#8217; him in and
givin&#8217; him the kind of care that money can&#8217;t buy.
There&#8217;s special reasons that I needn&#8217;t mention why
you should say thank you, and say it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia examined the toe of her boot for some
time in silence and then began:</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t understand the situation, Mrs.
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia, if you don&#8217;t stop that kind of thing, I
shall certainly send for the police. Are you <i>lookin&#8217;</i>
for a situation? If you have got anything to say,
say it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to be quite frank with you, Mrs. Burke,
I must confess that at one time Mr. Maxwell and I
were supposed to be very good friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally. You ought to be good friends with
your rector. I don&#8217;t see anything tragic about
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we were something more than friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you? You can&#8217;t believe all you hear
in a town like this. Maybe some one was foolin&#8217;
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to know what I am talking about. He
accepted our hospitality at Willow Bluff, and was so
attentive that people began to make remarks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, people have been makin&#8217; remarks ever since
Eve told Adam to put his apron on for dinner. Any
fool can make remarks, and the biggest fool is the
one who cares. Are you sure that you didn&#8217;t make
any remarks yourself, Virginia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia instantly bridled, and looked the picture
of injured innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;Do you think that
I would talk about such a delicate matter before
others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no; I suppose not. But you could look wise
and foolish at the same time when Maxwell&#8217;s name
was mentioned, with a coy and kittenish air which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
would suggest more than ten volumes of Mary Jane
Holmes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not very sympathetic, Mrs. Burke, when
I am in deep trouble. I want your help, not ridicule
and abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry for you, Virginia, in more ways
than one. But really I&#8217;d like to know what reason
you have to think that Donald Maxwell was ever in
love with you; I suppose that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia blushed deeply, as became a gentle maiden
of her tender years, and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is not a question of things which one can
easily define. Love is vocal without words, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! You don&#8217;t mean that he made love to you
and proposed to you through a phonograph? You
know I had some sort of idea that love that was all
wool, and a yard wide, and meant business, usually
got vocal at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Maxwell and I were thrown together in
such an intimate way in parish work, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which did the throwing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t for one moment suppose that I would
intrude myself, or press myself on his attention, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my gracious, no! He is not the kind of a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
to be easily impressed. He may have seen a girl or
two before he met you; of course I mean just incidentally,
as it were. Now, Virginia Bascom, allow
me to ask you one or two plain questions. Did he
ever ask you to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not in so many words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ever give you any plain indication that he
wanted to marry you? Did he ever play the mandolin
under your window at midnight? Did he ever steal
one of your gloves, or beg for a rose out of your
bouquet, or turn the gas out when he called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but one night he sat on the sofa with me and
told me that I was a great assistance to him in his
parish work, and that he felt greatly indebted to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! That&#8217;s certainly rather pronounced, isn&#8217;t
it? Did you call your father, or rise hastily and leave
the room, or what did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course it was not a proposal, but the
way he did it was very suggestive, and calculated to
give a wrong impression, especially as he had his arm
on the back of the sofa behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was makin&#8217; love to the sofa. Didn&#8217;t
you know that Donald Maxwell was engaged to be
married before he ever set foot in Durford?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, no! What are you talking about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he certainly was, for keeps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he had no business to pose as a free man,
if he were engaged. It is dreadful to have to lose
faith in one&#8217;s rector. It is next to losing faith in&mdash;in&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The milk-man. Yes, I quite agree with you. But
you see I don&#8217;t recall that Donald Maxwell did any
posing. He simply kept quiet about his own affairs&mdash;though
I do think that it would have been better
to let people know that he was engaged, from the
start. However, he may have concluded his private
affairs were his own business. I know that&#8217;s very
stupid; but some people will persist in doin&#8217; it, in spite
of all you can say to &#8217;em. Perhaps it never occurred
to him that he would be expected to marry anyone
living in a little sawed-off settlement like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use in abusing your native village;
and&#8221;&mdash;her voice quavered on the verge of tears&mdash;&#8220;I
think you are very unsympathetic.&#8221; She buried
her nose in her handkerchief.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke gazed sternly at Virginia for a full
minute and then inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do you want to know why? You started
with just foolishness, but you&#8217;ve ended up with meanness,
Virginia Bascom. You&#8217;ve taken your revenge
on people who&#8217;ve done you nothin&#8217; but kindness. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
know pretty well who it was that suggested to your
father that the mortgage on the rectory should be
foreclosed, and the Maxwells turned out of house and
home. He&#8217;s always been close-fisted, but I&#8217;ve never
known him to be dead ugly and vindictive before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You were behind all this wretched business&mdash;and
you&#8217;re sorry for it, and wish you could undo
the unkindness you&#8217;ve done. Now I am goin&#8217; to
talk business&mdash;better than talkin&#8217; sympathy, because
it&#8217;ll make you feel better when you&#8217;ve done what I
tell you. You go and call on Mrs. Betty immediately,
and tell her that you are very grateful to her husband
for saving your father&#8217;s life, and that money couldn&#8217;t
possibly pay for the things she and Mr. Maxwell did
for him, and that you&#8217;re everlastingly indebted to &#8217;em
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; wailed the repentant Virginia, &#8220;what
can I say about the tent? Pa won&#8217;t go back on that&mdash;not
if his life had been saved twice over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind about that. You do your part
of the business, and leave the rest to the other feller.
You can bet your bottom dollar it won&#8217;t be the Maxwells
that&#8217;ll raise the question of who turned &#8217;em out
of the rectory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go right away, before I weaken. Oh,&#8221; she
cried, as Hepsey put a strengthening arm about her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wrong&mdash;I know I have. However shall I
make it right again?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Virginia arrived at the tent and pulled the
bell-cord, Mrs. Betty pushed apart the curtains and
greeted her visitor with the utmost cordiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Bascom! I am <i>so</i> glad to see you.
Come right in. Donald is out just now; but he will
return presently, and I&#8217;m sure will be delighted to
see an old friend. This way, please. Is your father
improving satisfactorily?&#8221;</p>
<p>This greeting was so utterly different from what
she had expected, that for the moment she was silent;
but when they were seated she began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Maxwell, I don&#8217;t know how to express my
gratitude to you for all you have done for my father.
I&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wouldn&#8217;t try, Miss Bascom. Don&#8217;t give
the matter a single thought. We were glad to do
what we could for your father, and we made him as
comfortable as we could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s heart was quite atrophied, and so with
choking voice she began:</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m afraid that I have not been very civil to
you&mdash;in fact, I am sure that I owe you an apology&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, never mind. It&#8217;s all right now. Suppose you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
take off your things and stay to supper with us. Then
we can have a real good visit, and you will see how
well we dwellers in tents can live!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia winced; but for some reason which she
could not understand she found it quite impossible
to decline the invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you are very kind, Mrs. Maxwell; but
I&#8217;m afraid I shall inconvenience you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, not a bit. Now will you be a real good
Samaritan and help me a little, as I have no maid?
You might set the table if you don&#8217;t mind, and when
Donald comes we shall be ready for him. This is
really quite jolly,&#8221; she added, bustling about, showing
Virginia where to find things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; Virginia began with something like
a sob in her voice, &#8220;that you are heaping coals of fire
on my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no; not when coal is over seven dollars a ton.
We couldn&#8217;t afford such extravagant hospitality as
that. You might arrange those carnations in the vase
if you will, while I attend to the cooking. You will
find the china, and the silver, in that chest. I won&#8217;t
apologize for the primitive character of our entertainment
because you see when we came down here we
stored most of our things in Mrs. Burke&#8217;s barn. It
is awfully nice to have somebody with me; I am so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
much alone; you came just in time to save me from
the blues.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mrs. Betty disappeared in the &#8220;kitchen,&#8221; and
Virginia began the task assigned her, a very queer
and not altogether pleasant sensation filled her heart.
Was it remorse, or penitence, or self-reproach, or
indigestion? She could not be absolutely sure about
it, but concluded that perhaps it was a combination
of all four. When Donald returned, and discovered
Virginia trying to decide whether they would need
two spoons or three at each plate, for an instant he
was too astonished to speak; but quickly regaining his
easy manner, he welcomed her no less cordially than
Mrs. Betty had done, remarking:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a treat; and so you are going to have
supper with us? That will be a great pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia almost collapsed in momentary embarrassment,
and could think of nothing better than to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure what Mrs. Maxwell is going to
have for supper, and I really don&#8217;t know whether to
place two spoons or three. What would you advise,
Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell scowled seriously, rubbed his chin and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, I really can&#8217;t say; but perhaps
it would be on the safe side to have three spoons in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
case any emergency might arise, like a custard, or
jelly and whipped cream, or something else which
Betty likes to make as a surprise. Yes, on the whole,
I think that three would be better than two.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Virginia had placed the spoons, and Maxwell
had returned to assist her, she hesitated a moment
and looked at him with tears in her eyes and
began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Maxwell, there is something I must say to
you, an acknowledgment and an apology I must make.
I have been so horribly&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Miss Virginia,&#8221; the rector replied,
&#8220;you just forget it. We are awfully glad to have you
here, and we are going to have a right jolly supper
together. Betty&#8217;s muffins are simply fine, and her
creamed chicken is a dream. Besides, I want to consult
you concerning the new wardrobe I am going to
have built in the vestry. You see there is the question
of the drawers, and the shelves, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the drawers and the shelves,&#8221; Mrs.
Betty remarked as she entered with the creamed
chicken and the muffins. &#8220;You just sit down before
these things get cold, and you can talk business afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>To her utter astonishment Virginia soon found herself
eating heartily, utterly at her ease in the cordial,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
friendly atmosphere of tent-life, and when Maxwell
took her home later in the evening, she hadn&#8217;t apologized
or wallowed in an agony of self-reproach. She
had only demanded the recipe for the muffins, and
had declared that she was coming again very soon if
Mrs. Betty would only let her.</p>
<p>And last but not least&mdash;the rector&#8217;s polite attention
in acting as her escort home failed to work upon
her dramatic temperament with any more startling
effect than to produce a feeling that he was a very
good friend.</p>
<p>In fact, she wondered, as she conned over the
events of the evening, whether she had realized before,
all that the word <i>Friendship</i> signified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>HEPSEY&#8217;S DIPLOMACY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know what&#8217;s got into Virginia
Bascom,&#8221; remarked Jonathan, as he sat on
Hepsey&#8217;s side porch one evening, making polite
conversation as his new habit was. &#8220;She&#8217;s buzzin&#8217;
round Mrs. Betty like a bee round a flower&mdash;thicker&#8217;n
thieves they be, by gum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cogitated Hepsey, half to herself, and half
in response, &#8220;the lamb&#8217;s lyin&#8217; down all right, and it&#8217;s
about time we&#8217;d got the lion curled up by her and
purrin&#8217; like a cat. But I don&#8217;t see the signs of it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
I&#8217;ll have to take my knittin&#8217; to-morrow and sit right
down in his den and visit with him a little. If he
won&#8217;t purr, I&#8217;ve got what&#8217;ll make him roar, good and
proper, or I&#8217;ve missed my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Hepsey, you go easy with my church-partner,
the Senior Warden. When his wife lived, he
was a decent sort of a feller, was Sylvester Bascom;
and I reckon she got him comin&#8217; her way more with
molasses than with vinegar.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though Hepsey snorted contempt for the advice
of a mere male, she found the thought top-side
of her mind as she started out next morning to pay
Bascom a momentous call. After all, Jonathan had
but echoed her own consistent philosophy of life. But
with her usual shrewdness she decided to go armed
with both kinds of ammunition.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke puffed somewhat loudly as she paused
on the landing which led to the door of Bascom&#8217;s
office. After wiping her forehead with her handkerchief
she gave three loud knocks on the painted glass
of the door, which shook some of the loose putty onto
the floor. After knocking the third time some one
called out &#8220;Come in,&#8221; and she opened the door, entered,
and gazed calmly across the room. Bascom
was seated at his desk talking to a farmer,
and when he turned around and discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
who his visitor was, he ejaculated irreverently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord deliver us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do excuse me!&#8221; Mrs. Burke replied. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know that you were sayin&#8217; the Litany. I&#8217;ll just slip
into the next room and wait till you get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon she stepped into the next room, closed
the door, and made herself comfortable in a large
arm-chair. There was a long table in the middle of
the room, and the walls were covered with shelves
and yellow books of a most monotonous binding. The
air was musty and close. She quietly opened one of
the windows, and having resumed her seat, she pulled
a wash-rag from her leather bag and began knitting
calmly.</p>
<p>She waited for some time, occasionally glancing at
the long table, which was covered with what appeared
to be a hopeless confusion of letters, legal documents,
and books opened and turned face downward. Occasionally
she sniffed in disgust at the general untidiness
of the place. Evidently the appearance of the
table in front of her was getting on her nerves; and
so she put her knitting away as she muttered to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder Virginia don&#8217;t come up here once in a
while and put things to rights. It&#8217;s simply awful!&#8221;
Then she began sorting the papers and gathering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
them into little uniform piles by themselves. She
seemed to have no notion whatever of their possible
relation to each other, but arranged them according
to their size and color in nice little separate piles.
When there was nothing else left for her to do she
resumed her knitting and waited patiently for the departure
of the farmer. The two men seemed to be
having a rather warm dispute over the interpretation
of some legal contract; and if Bascom was hot-tempered
and emphatic in his language, bordering on the
profane, the client was stubborn and dull-witted and
hard to convince. Occasionally she overheard bits of
the controversy which were not intended for her ears.
Bascom insisted:</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not such a dum fool as to think that a
contract legally made between two parties is not binding,
are you? You admit that I have fulfilled my
part, and now you must pay for the services rendered
or else I shall bring suit against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply to this was not audible, but the farmer
did not seem to be quite convinced.</p>
<p>After what seemed to her an interminable interval
the door banged, and she knew that Bascom was
alone. She did not wait for any invitation, but rising
quietly she went into the inner office and took the
chair vacated by the farmer. Bascom made a pretense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
of writing, in silence, with his back towards her,
during which interval Hepsey waited patiently. Then,
looking up with the expression of a deaf-mute, he
asked colorlessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Burke, what may I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do nothing for me&mdash;but you can and
must do something for the Maxwells,&#8221; she replied
firmly but quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would be better to let Maxwell
take care of his own affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, most certainly, if he were in a position to do
so. But you know that the clergy are a long-sufferin&#8217;
lot, more&#8217;s the pity; they&#8217;ll endure almost anythin&#8217;
rather than complain. That&#8217;s why you and others
take advantage of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but an earnest minister of the Gospel does
not look for the loaves and fishes of his calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think he would. I hate fish, myself;
but Maxwell has a perfect right to look for the honest
fulfillment of a contract made between you and
him. Didn&#8217;t I hear you tell that farmer that he was
a dum fool if he thought that a contract made between
two parties is not legally binding, and that if
you fulfilled your part he must pay for your services
or you would sue him? Do you suppose that a contract
with a carpenter or a plumber or a mason is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
binding, while a contract with a clergyman is not?
What is the matter with you, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bascom made no reply, but turned his back towards
Hepsey and started to write. She resumed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald Maxwell&#8217;s salary is goin&#8217; to be paid him
in full within the next two weeks or&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burke came to a sudden silence, and after a
moment or two Bascom turned around and inquired
sarcastically:</p>
<p>&#8220;Or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey continued to knit in silence for a while,
her face working in her effort to gain control of herself
and speak calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Sylvester Bascom: I didn&#8217;t come
here to have a scene with you, and if I knit like I
was fussed, you must excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her needles had been flashing lightning, and truth
to tell, Bascom, for all he dreaded Hepsey&#8217;s sharp
tongue as nothing else in Durford, had been unable
to keep his eyes off those angry bits of sparkling steel.
Suddenly they stopped&mdash;dead. The knitting fell into
Hepsey&#8217;s lap, and she sat forward&mdash;a pair of kindly,
moist eyes searching the depths of Bascom&#8217;s, as he
looked up at her. Her voice dropped to a lower tone
as she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been just one person, and one person only,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
that&#8217;s ever been able to keep the best of you on top&mdash;and
she was my best friend, your wife. She kept
you human, and turned even the worst side of you to
some account. If you did scrape and grub, &#8217;most
night and day, to make your pile, and was hard on
those that crossed your path while doin&#8217; of it, it was
she that showed you there was pleasure in usin&#8217; it
for others as well as for yourself, and while she lived
you did it. But since she&#8217;s been gone,&#8221;&mdash;the old
man tried to keep his face firm and his glance steady,
but in vain&mdash;he winced,&mdash;&#8220;since she&#8217;s been gone, the
human in you&#8217;s dried up like a sun-baked apple. And
it&#8217;s you, Sylvester Bascom, that&#8217;s been made the most
miserable, &#8217;spite of all the little carks you&#8217;ve put on
many another.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face hardened again, and Hepsey paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has all this to do with Mr. Maxwell, may
I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m comin&#8217; to that,&#8221; continued Hepsey, patiently.
&#8220;If Mary Bascom were alive to-day, would the rector
of Durford be livin&#8217; in a tent instead of in the rectory&mdash;the
house she thought she had given over, without
mortgage or anything else, to the church? And
would you be holdin&#8217; back your subscription to the
church, and seein&#8217; that others held back too? I never
thought you&#8217;d have done, when she was dead, what&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
have broken her heart if she&#8217;d been livin&#8217;. The
church was her one great interest in life, after her
husband and her daughter; and it was <i>her</i> good work
that brought the parish to make you Senior Warden.
After you&#8217;d made money and moved to your new
house, just before she died, she gave the old house,
that was hers from her father, to the church, and you
were to make the legal transfer of it. Then she died
suddenly, and you delayed and delayed&mdash;claiming the
house as yours, and at last sold it to us subject to the
mortgage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all quite beside the mark. What might
have been proper to do in my wife&#8217;s life-time became
a different matter altogether after her death. I had
my daughter&#8217;s welfare to think of; besides&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talkin&#8217; about your legal right. But you
know that if you&#8217;d wanted to have it, you could have
got your interest on the mortgage quick enough. If
you hadn&#8217;t held back on his salary, others wouldn&#8217;t
have; or if they had, you could have got after &#8217;em.
What&#8217;s the use of tryin&#8217; to mix each other up? You
couldn&#8217;t keep Maxwell in your pocket, and because
he didn&#8217;t come to you every day for orders you reckoned
to turn him out of the parish. You&#8217;ve not one
thing against him, and you know it, Sylvester Bascom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
He&#8217;s shown you every kind of respect as his Senior
Warden, and more patience than you deserved. He
let himself be&mdash;no, <i>had</i> himself&mdash;bled, to save your
life. But instead of making him the best young friend
you could have had, and makin&#8217; yourself of real use
to your town and your neighbors through him and his
work, you&#8217;ve let the devil get into you; and when
your accident come, you&#8217;d got to where you were runnin&#8217;
that fast down a steep place into the sea that I
could &#8217;most hear the splash.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cocked her head on one side, and smiled at him
whimsically, hoping for some response to her humorous
picture. A faint ghost of a smile&mdash;was it, or was
it not?&mdash;flickered on the old man&#8217;s lips; but he gave
no sign of grace.</p>
<p>Hepsey sighed, and paused for an instant. &#8220;Well&mdash;we
can&#8217;t sit here talkin&#8217; till midnight, or I shall be
compromisin&#8217; your reputation, I suppose. There&#8217;ll
be a meeting of the parishioners called at the end of
this week, and the rector won&#8217;t be present at it; so,
Warden, I suppose you&#8217;ll preside. I hope you will.
I&#8217;ve got to do my part&mdash;and that is to see that the parish
understands just how their rector&#8217;s placed, right
now, both about his house and his salary. He&#8217;s workin&#8217;
as a laborer to get enough for him and that little
wife of his to live on, and the town knows it&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
they don&#8217;t all know that it&#8217;s because the salary that&#8217;s
properly his is bein&#8217; held back on him, and by those
that pay their chauffeurs more than the rector gets,
by a good piece. I shall call on every one at that
meetin&#8217; to pay up; and I shall begin with the poorest,
and end up&#8221;&mdash;she fixed Bascom&#8217;s eye, significantly&mdash;&#8220;with
the richest. And if it seems to be my duty to
do it, I may have somethin&#8217; more to say when the subscription&#8217;s
closed&mdash;but I don&#8217;t believe&mdash;no,&#8221; she added,
opening her bag and rummaging about among its
contents till she hit upon a letter and brought it forth,
&#8220;no, I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll have to say a thing. I&#8217;ve
got a hunch, Sylvester Bascom, that it&#8217;ll be you that&#8217;ll
have the last word, after all.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;I&#8217;VE GOT A HUNCH, SYLVESTER BASCOM, THAT IT&#8217;LL BE YOU THAT&#8217;LL HAVE THE LAST WORD, AFTER ALL&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The old man&#8217;s glance was riveted upon the familiar
handwriting of the faded letter, and without a word
Hepsey started to read it, date and all, in a clear
voice:</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 1.5625em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Willow Bluff, Durford</span>.</span><br />
September &#8211;&#8211;, 19&mdash;.<br /></p>
<p><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Hepsey dear</span>:</p>
<p>I suppose you will never forgive me for making the
move from the old house to Willow Bluff, as it&#8217;s to
be called, while you were not home to help me. But
they got finished sooner than we thought for, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Sylvester was as eager as a child with a new toy to
get moved in. So here we are, and the first letter I
write from our new home is to you, who helped more
than anyone to make the old home happy for me and
mine&mdash;bless them and bless you!</p>
<p>Everything is out of the old house&mdash;&#8220;The Rectory&#8221;
as I shall call it, now&mdash;except such pieces of furniture
as we did not want to take away, and we thought
might be welcome to the parson (or parsons, I suppose)
who may occupy it. Sister Susan thought it
slighting to Pa&#8217;s generosity to give the house to the
church; but I don&#8217;t look at it like that. Anyway, it&#8217;s
done now&mdash;and I&#8217;m very happy to think that the flock
can offer a proper home to its shepherd, as long as
the old place stands.</p>
<p>If you get back Thursday I shall just be ready for

<p>P. S. Ginty sends her love to Aunt Hepsey, and
says, &#8220;to come to Boston quick!&#8221; She&#8217;s a little confused,
someway, and can&#8217;t get it out of her head that
we&#8217;re not back home in Boston, since we left the old

<p>As Hepsey read, Sylvester Bascom turned, slowly,
away from her, his head on his hand, gazing out of
the window. When she had finished reading, the letter
was folded up and replaced in the bag along with
her knitting. Then, laying her hand with a gentle,
firm pressure on the old man&#8217;s shoulder, Mrs. Burke
departed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>HEPSEY CALLS A MEETING</h3>
</div>
<p>For the next few days Hepsey&#8217;s mind worked
in unfamiliar channels, for her nature was
that of a benevolent autocrat, and she had
found herself led by circumstances into a situation demanding
the prowess and elasticity of the diplomat.
To begin with, she must risk a gamble at the meeting:
if the spiritual yeast did not rise in old Bascom,
as she hoped it would, and crown her strategy with
success, she would have to fall back on belligerent
tactics, and see if it were not possible to get his duty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
out of him by threatened force of public opinion: and
she knew that, with his obstinacy, it would be touch
and go on which side of the fence he would fall in
a situation of that kind&mdash;dependent, in fact, upon the
half turn of a screw, more or less, for the result.
Furthermore, she concluded that beyond the vaguest
hint of her call on Bascom and the object of the
meeting, she could not show her hand to Maxwell;
for he would feel it his duty to step in and prevent
the possibility of any such open breach as failure on
Hepsey&#8217;s part would probably make in the parish
solidarity. For once she must keep her own counsel&mdash;except
for Jonathan, whose present infatuated condition
made him an even safer and more satisfactory
source of &#8220;advice&#8221; than he normally was. But the
evening before the meeting, as he sat on Hepsey&#8217;s
porch, he began to experience qualms, perhaps in his
capacity as Junior Warden. But Hepsey turned upon
him relentlessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here! You know I don&#8217;t start somethin&#8217;
unless I can see it through; and if it means a
scrap, so much the better. Next to a good revival,
a good hard scrap in a stupid parish has a real spiritual
value. It stimulates the circulation, increases
the appetite, gives people somethin&#8217; to think about,
and does a lot of good where peaceful ways would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
fail. The trouble with us is that we&#8217;ve always been
a sight too peaceful. If I&#8217;ve got to do it, I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to make a row, a real jolly row that&#8217;ll make some
people wish they&#8217;d never been born. No-no-no! Don&#8217;t
you try to interfere. We&#8217;ve come to a crisis, and I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to meet it. Don&#8217;t you worry until I begin to
holler for first aid to the injured. A woman can&#8217;t
vote for a vestryman, though women form the bulk
of the congregation, and do most all of the parish
work; and the whole church&#8217;d go to smithereens if it
weren&#8217;t for the women. But there&#8217;s one thing a woman
can always do: <i>She can talk</i>. They say that talk
is cheap; but sometimes it&#8217;s a mighty expensive article,
if it&#8217;s the right kind; and maybe the men will have
to settle the bills. I&#8217;m going to <i>talk</i>; perhaps you
think that&#8217;s nothing new. But you don&#8217;t know how I
can talk when once I get my dander up. Somebody&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to sit up and pay attention this time. Bascom&#8217;ll
conclude to preside at the meetin&#8217;; whichever way he
means to act; and I&#8217;ve fixed it so Maxwell will be
engaged on other duties. No; go &#8217;way. I don&#8217;t want
to see you around here again until the whole thing&#8217;s
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right Hepsey, all right. I guess if it goes
through the way you want you&#8217;ll be that set up you&#8217;ll
be wantin&#8217; to marry old Bascom &#8217;stead of me,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
chuckled Jonathan, as the lady of his choice turned
to enter the house.</p>
<p>She faced round upon him as she reached the door,
her features set with grim determination:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get the whole caboodle, bag and baggage,
from the meetin&#8217; and from Bascom, there&#8217;s no knowin&#8217;
but what I&#8217;ll send for the parson and be married
right there and then. There isn&#8217;t a thing I could
think of, in the line of a real expensive sacrifice, that&#8217;d
measure up as compensation for winnin&#8217; out&mdash;not
even marryin&#8217; you, Jonathan Jackson.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Hepsey laid down lines for control of the meeting,
ready with a different variety of expedients, from
point to point in its progress, as Sylvester Bascom&#8217;s
attitude at the time might necessitate. For she felt
very little anxiety as to her ability to carry the main
body of the audience along with her.</p>
<p>The night of the meeting the Sunday School Room,
adjacent to the church, was filled full to a seat at least
a quarter of an hour before the time announced for
the meeting. Hepsey had provided herself with a
chair in the center of the front row, directly facing
the low platform to be occupied by the chairman.
Her leather bag hung formidably on one arm, and
a long narrow blank book was laid on her lap. She
took little notice of her surroundings, and her anxiety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
was imperceptible, as she thrummed with a pencil
upon the book, glancing now and then at the side
door, watching for Bascom&#8217;s entrance. The meeting
buzzed light conversation, as a preliminary. Had
she miscalculated on the very first move? Was he
going to treat the whole affair with lofty disdain?
As the hour struck, dead silence reigned in the room,
expectant; and Jonathan, who sat next her, fidgeted
nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five minutes&#8217; grace, and that&#8217;s all; if he&#8217;s not
here by then, it&#8217;ll be up to you to call the meetin&#8217; to
order,&#8221; whispered Hepsey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes!&#8221; hissed the terrified Junior Warden, &#8220;you
didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; about that, Hepsey,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>She leveled a withering glance at him, and was
about to reduce him to utter impotence by some scathing
remark, when both were startled by a voice in
front of them, issuing from &#8220;the chair.&#8221; Silently the
Senior Warden had entered, and had proceeded to
open the meeting. His face was set and stern, and
his voice hard and toneless. No help from that quarter,
Hepsey mentally recorded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the rector of this parish is not able to be present
I have been asked to preside at this meeting. I
believe that it was instigated&mdash;that is suggested, by
some of the ladies who believe that there are some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
matters of importance which need immediate attention,
and must be presented to the congregation without
delay. I must beg to remind these ladies that the
Wardens and Vestrymen are the business officers of
the church; and it seems to my poor judgment that
if any business is to be transacted, the proper way
would be for the Vestry to take care of it. However,
I have complied with the request and have undertaken
to preside, in the absence of the rector. The
meeting is now open for business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bascom sat down and gazed at the audience, but
with a stare so expressionless as gave no further index
to his mood. For some time there was a rather
painful silence; but at last Hepsey Burke arose and
faced about to command the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brethren and sisters,&#8221; she began, &#8220;a few of us
women have made up our minds that it&#8217;s high time
that somethin&#8217; was done towards payin&#8217; our rector
what we owe him, and that we furnish him with a
proper house to live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, a faint murmur of applause interrupted
the speaker, who replied: &#8220;There. There.
Don&#8217;t be too quick. You won&#8217;t feel a bit like applaudin&#8217;
when I get through. It&#8217;s a burnin&#8217; shame
and disgrace that we owe Mr. Maxwell about two
hundred dollars, which means a mighty lot to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
because if he was paid in full every month he would
get just about enough to keep his wife and himself
from starvin&#8217; to death. I wasn&#8217;t asked to call this
meetin&#8217;; I asked the rector to, and I asked the Senior
Warden to preside. And I told the rector that some
of us&mdash;both men and women&mdash;had business to talk
about that wasn&#8217;t for his ears. For all he knows,
we&#8217;re here to pass a vote of censure on him. The fact
is that we have reached the point where somethin&#8217;
has got to be done right off quick; and if none of the
Vestrymen do it, then a poor shrinkin&#8217; little woman
like myself has got to rise and mount the band wagon.
I&#8217;m no woman&#8217;s rights woman, but I have a conscience
that&#8217;ll keep me awake nights until I have freed
my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Hepsey paused, and twirling her pencil between
her lips, gazed around at her auditors who
were listening with breathless attention. Then she
suddenly exclaimed with suppressed wrath, and in
her penetrating tones:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you men, anyway? You&#8217;d
have to pay your butcher, or your baker, or your
grocer, whether you wanted to or not. Then why in
the name of conscience don&#8217;t you pay your parson?
Certainly religion that don&#8217;t cost nothin&#8217; is worse
than nothin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll tell you the reason why you don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
support your parson: It&#8217;s just because your rector&#8217;s
a gentleman, and can&#8217;t very well kick over the traces,
or balk, or sue you, even if you do starve him. So
you, prosperous, big-headed men think that you can
sneak out of it. Oh, you needn&#8217;t shuffle and look
mad; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get the truth for once, and I had
Johnny Mullins lock the front door before I began.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole audience responded to this sally with a
laugh, but the speaker relented not one iota. &#8220;Then
when you&#8217;ve smit your rector on one cheek you quote
the Bible to make him think he ought to turn his
overcoat also.&#8221; Another roar. &#8220;There: you don&#8217;t
need to think I&#8217;m havin&#8217; a game. I&#8217;m not through
yet. Now let&#8217;s get right down to business. We owe
our rector a lot of money, and he is livin&#8217; in a tent
because we neglected to pay the interest on the rectory
mortgage held by the Senior Warden of our church.
Talkin&#8217; plain business, and nothin&#8217; else, turned him
out of house and home, and we broke our business
contract with him. Yes we did! And now you know
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of us have been sayin&#8217;&mdash;and I was one of
&#8217;em till Mr. Maxwell corrected me&mdash;that it was mean
of Mr. Bascom to turn the rector and his wife out
of their house. But business is business, and until
we&#8217;ve paid the last cent of our contributions, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
haven&#8217;t any right to throw stones at anyone. Wait
till we&#8217;ve done our part, for that! We&#8217;ve been the
laughing stock of the whole town because of our
pesky meanness. That tent of ours has stuck out on
the landscape like a horse fly on a pillow sham.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my business to tell how the rector and his
wife have had to economize and suffer, to get along
at all; or how nice and uncomplainin&#8217; they&#8217;ve been
through it all. They wouldn&#8217;t want me to say anythin&#8217;
of that; sportsmen they are, both of &#8217;em. The
price of food&#8217;s gone up, and the rector&#8217;s salary gone
down like a teeter on a log.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, as I remarked before, let&#8217;s get right down
to business. The only way to raise that money is to
raise it! There&#8217;s no use larkin&#8217; all &#8217;round Robin
Hood&#8217;s barn, or scampering round the mulberry bush
any longer. I don&#8217;t care for fairs myself, where you
have to go and buy somethin&#8217; you don&#8217;t want, for
five times what it&#8217;s worth, and call it givin&#8217; to the
Lord. And I don&#8217;t care to give a chicken, and then
have to pay for eatin&#8217; the same old bird afterwards.
I won&#8217;t eat soda biscuit unless I know who made &#8217;em.
Church fairs are an invention of the devil to make
people think they&#8217;re religious, when they are only
mighty restless and selfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing to do is to put your hands in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
trousers pockets and pay, cash down, just as you
would in any business transaction. And by cash, I
don&#8217;t mean five cents in the plate Sunday, and a dollar
for a show on Tuesday. We&#8217;ve none of us any business
to pretend to give to the Lord what doesn&#8217;t cost
a red cent, as the Bible says, somewheres. Now don&#8217;t
get nervous. I&#8217;m going to start a subscription paper
right here and now. It&#8217;ll save lots of trouble, and
you ought to jump at the chance. You&#8217;ll be votin&#8217;
me a plated ice-water pitcher before we get through,
for bein&#8217; so good to you&mdash;just as a little souvenir of
the evenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A disjointed murmur of disapproval rose from sundry
parts of the room at this summary way of meeting
the emergency. Nelson, who had tried in vain to
catch the eye of the chair, rose at a venture and remarked
truculently:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a most unusual proceeding, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chair remained immobile&mdash;but Hepsey turned
upon the foe like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely, Mr. Nelson. And we are a most unusual
parish. I don&#8217;t claim to have any information
gained by world-wide travel, but livin&#8217; my life as I&#8217;ve
found it here, in ths town, I&#8217;ve got to say, that this
is the first time I ever heard of a church turnin&#8217; its
rector out of house and home, and refusin&#8217; to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
him salary enough to buy food for his family. Maybe
in the course of your professional travels this
thing has got to be an everyday occurrence to you,&mdash;but
there&#8217;s some of us here, that &#8217;aint got much interest
in such goings-on, outside of Durford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no authority to raise money for the
church; I believe the Warden will concur in that opinion?&#8221;
and he bowed towards Bascom.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a point for the meeting to decide,&#8221; he replied
judicially, as Hepsey turned towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; continued Mrs. Burke, facing the
audience, &#8220;that authority won&#8217;t fill the rector&#8217;s purse
so well as cash. It&#8217;s awful curious how a church with
six Vestrymen and two Wardens, all of them good
business men&mdash;men that can squeeze money out of a
monkey-wrench, and always get the best of the other
fellow in a horse-trade, and smoke cigars enough to
pay the rector&#8217;s whole salary&mdash;get limp and faint and
find it necessary to fall back on talkin&#8217; about &#8216;authority&#8217;
when any money is to be raised. What we want
in the parish is not authority, but just everyday plain
business hustle, the sort of hustle that wears trousers;
and as we don&#8217;t seem to get that, the next best kind is
the sort that wears skirts. I&#8217;d always rather that men
shall do the public work than women; but if men
won&#8217;t, women must. What we need right here in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Durford is a few full grown men who aren&#8217;t shirks
or quitters, who can put up prayers with one hand
while they put down the cash with the other; and I
don&#8217;t believe the Lord ever laid it up against any
man who paid first, and prayed afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now brethren, don&#8217;t all speak at once. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to start takin&#8217; subscriptions. Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to head the
list?&#8221;</p>
<p>A little withered old woman laboriously struggled
to her feet, and in a high-pitched, quavering voice
began:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to give suthin&#8217; towards the end in view.
Our rector were powerful good to my Thomas when
he had the brown kitties in his throat. He came to
see him mos&#8217; every day and read to him, and said
prayers with him, and brought him papers and jelly.
He certainly were powerful good to my Thomas;
and once when Thomas had a fever our rector said
that he thought that a bath would do my Thomas a
heap of good, and he guessed he&#8217;d give him one. So
I got some water in a bowl and some soap, and our
rector he just took off his coat, and his vest, and his
collar, and his cuffs, and our rector he washed Thomas,
and he washed him, and he wa&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Hepsey interrupted, to stay the flow of eloquence,
&#8220;so you&#8217;d like to pay for his laundry now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
would you Mrs. Sumner? Shall I put you down for
two dollars? Good! Mrs. Sumner sets the ball rollin&#8217;
with two dollars. Who&#8217;ll be the next?&#8221;</p>
<p>As there was no response, Mrs. Burke glanced
critically over the assembly until she had picked her
man, and then announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiram Mason, I&#8217;m sure you must be on the anxious
bench?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiram colored painfully as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I am prepared to say what I can
give, just at present, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now let&#8217;s think about it a little. Last night&#8217;s
<i>Daily Bugle</i> had your name in a list of those that gave
ten dollars apiece at St. Bridget&#8217;s fair. I suppose the
Irish trade&#8217;s valuable to a grocer like yourself; but
you surely can&#8217;t do less for your own church? I&#8217;ll
put you down for ten, though of course you can
double it if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hiram, meditatively; &#8220;I guess ten&#8217;ll
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiram Mason gives ten dollars. The Lord loveth
a cheerful giver. Thanks, Hiram.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a pause; and as no one volunteered,
Hepsey continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sylvester Perkins, how much will you give?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll give five dollars,&#8221; Sylvester responded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
before Mrs. Burke could have a chance to put him
down for a larger sum. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t like this way
of doin&#8217; things a little bit. It&#8217;s not a woman&#8217;s
place to hold up a man and rob him in public
meetin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a woman usually goes through her husband&#8217;s
pockets when he&#8217;s asleep, I suppose. But you see I&#8217;m
not your wife. Thanks, Mr. Perkins: Mr. Perkins,
<i>five</i> dollars,&#8221; she repeated as she entered his subscription
in the book. &#8220;Next?&#8221; she called briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, I&#8217;ll give twenty dollars, if you think
that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; called a voice from the back timidly.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to the speaker in some surprise.
He was a delicate, slender fellow, evidently in bad
health. He trembled nervously, and Mrs. Burke
hesitated for an instant, between fear of hurting his
feelings and letting him give more than she knew he
could possibly afford.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you ought not to give so much, Amos.
Let me put you down for five,&#8221; she said kindly. &#8220;We
mustn&#8217;t rob Peter to pay Paul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, put me down for twenty,&#8221; he persisted;
and then burst forth&mdash;&#8220;and I wish it was
twenty thousand. I&#8217;d do anything for Mr. Maxwell;
I owe it to him, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker hesitated a moment and wiped his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
forehead with his handkerchief, and then continued
slowly, and with obvious effort:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll think I am a fool to give myself
away before a crowd like this, and I a member of
the church; but the simple fact is that Mr. Maxwell
saved my life once, when I was pretty near all in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the speaker stopped, breathing heavily, and
there was absolute silence in the room. Regaining his
courage, he continued: &#8220;Yes, he saved me, body and
soul, and I guess I&#8217;ll tell the whole story. Most of
you would have kicked me into the street or lodged
me in jail; but he wasn&#8217;t that kind, thank God!</p>
<p>&#8220;I was clerking in the Post Office a while back, and
I left town one night, suddenly. I&#8217;d been drinking
some, and when I left, my accounts were two hundred
dollars short. The thing was kept quiet. Only two
men knew about it. Mr. Maxwell was one. He got
the other man to keep his mouth shut, handed over
the amount, and chased after me and made me come
back with him and stay at his house for a while. Then
he gave me some work and helped me to make a new
start. He didn&#8217;t say a word of reproach, nor he
didn&#8217;t talk religion to me. He just acted as if he
cared a whole lot for me, and wanted to put me on
my feet again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know for a long time where Mr. Maxwell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
got the money for me but after a while I discovered
that he&#8217;d given a chattel mortgage on his
books and personal belongings. Do you suppose
that there&#8217;s anybody else in the world would have
done that for me? It wasn&#8217;t only his giving me the
money; it was finding that somebody trusted me and
cared for me, who had no business to trust me, and
couldn&#8217;t afford to trust me. That&#8217;s what saved me
and kept me straight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t touched a drop since, and I never will.
I&#8217;ve been paying my debt to him as quick as I can,
and as far as money can pay it; but all the gold in
the world wouldn&#8217;t even me up with him. I don&#8217;t
know just why I&#8217;ve told all about it, but I guess it&#8217;s
because I felt you ought to know the kind of a man
the rector is; and I&#8217;m glad he isn&#8217;t here, or he&#8217;d never
have let me give him away like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos sat down, while the astonished gathering
stared at him, the defaulter, who in a moment of
gratitude had betrayed himself. The woman next to
him edged a little farther away from him and watched
him furtively, but he did not seem to care.</p>
<p>Under the stimulus of this confession, the feelings
of the people quickly responded to the occasion, and
a line soon formed, without further need of wit or
eloquence on Hepsey&#8217;s part, to have their subscriptions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
recorded. In half an hour, Mrs. Burke, whose
face was glowing with pleasure&mdash;albeit she glanced
anxiously from time to time towards old Mr. Bascom,
in an endeavor to size up his mood and force
his intentions&mdash;had written down the name of the last
volunteer. She turned towards her audience:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I don&#8217;t want to keep you waitin&#8217; here all night
while I add up the subscriptions, I&#8217;ll ask the chairman
to do it for me and let you know the result. He&#8217;s
quicker at figurin&#8217; than I am, I guess,&#8221; with which
compliment, she smilingly handed the book to the
Senior Warden. While the old man bent to his task,
the room buzzed with low, excited conversation.
Enough was already known of Bascom&#8217;s hostility to
the rector, to make the meeting decidedly curious as
to his attitude towards Hepsey&#8217;s remarks and the
mortgage; and they knew him well enough to be
aware that he would not allow that item in her speech
to go unanswered, in some way or other.</p>
<p>All eyes rested upon the gaunt figure of the chairman,
as he rose to his feet to announce the total of
the subscription list. He cleared his throat, and
looked down at Hepsey Burke; and Jonathan, as he
squinted anxiously at Hepsey by his side, noticed that
she sat with her eyes tight-closed, oblivious of the
chairman&#8217;s glance. Jonathan looked hastily up at Bascom,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
and noticed him shift his position a little nervously,
as he cleared his throat again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount subscribed on this list, is two hundred
and thirty-seven dollars and thirty-five cents,&#8221; he
said. The loud applause was instantaneous, and Jonathan
turned quickly to Hepsey, as he stamped his
feet and clapped his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-seven thirty-five more than we owe him;
Hepsey, you&#8217;ve done fine,&#8221; he chortled.</p>
<p>But Hepsey&#8217;s look was now riveted on the chairman,
and except for a half-absent smile of pleasure,
the keenest anxiety showed in her expression.</p>
<p>Bascom cleared his voice again, and then proceeded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke informed you that the rector&#8217;s salary
was in arrears to the extent of about two hundred
dollars. It is now for this meeting to pass a formal
resolution for the application of the amount subscribed
to the object in view.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsey&#8217;s lips narrowed; not a cent was down on
the list to the name of the Senior Warden; the debt
was being paid without assistance from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume I may put it to the meeting that the
amount, when collected, be paid over to the rector by
a committee formed for that purpose?&#8221; proceeded
the chairman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>This resolution being duly seconded and carried,
Bascom continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we adjourn I request the opportunity to
make a few remarks, in reply to Mrs. Burke&#8217;s observations
concerning the ejection of the rector from
the house which he occupied. She was good enough
to spare my feelings by pointing out that from a business
or legal point of view it was not I who was responsible
for that act, but the parishioners, who, having
purchased the rectory subject to a mortgage, had
failed to meet the interest upon it. That is what Mrs.
Burke said: what she did not say, and what none of
you have said in public, though I reckon you&#8217;ve said
it among yourselves, I will take upon myself to say
for her and you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused&mdash;and every eye was fixed upon him and
every mouth agape in paralysed astonishment: and
the said features of Hepsey Burke were no exception
to the rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;When,&#8221; continued Bascom evenly and urbanely,
&#8220;the word went round that the interest on the mortgage
had got behind, and the money must be collected
for it, those concerned no doubt remarked easily: &#8216;Oh,
I guess that&#8217;ll be all right. Bascom won&#8217;t worry about
that; he don&#8217;t need it; anyway he can pay it to himself,
for the parish, if he does.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>There was an uncomfortable stirring of the audience
at this shrewd thrust; but Hepsey could not contain
herself, and laughed right out, clapping loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet I don&#8217;t mind saying that if I had thought
of suggesting to anyone of you such a method of collecting
interest due to you, you might have kicked
some,&#8221; he commented dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the next step, when I ultimately concluded to
act upon my right to eject Mr. Maxwell from the
rectory, I&#8217;ve no doubt that on all sides it was: &#8216;Well,
did you ever know the likes of that? Turning the
rector out of house and home! Well he&#8217;s a skinflint
for fair!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and watched the effect. This time his
hearers sat absolutely motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I agree with you,&#8221; he added presently, in a
quiet voice: &#8220;I <i>was</i> a skinflint for fair!&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost Hepsey forgot herself so far as to clap
thunderously: she caught her hands together just in
time&mdash;recollecting that her demonstration would be
taken too literally.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would not have you misunderstand me:
though it was for me to call myself a skinflint for that
act, it was not for you to do so. You did so on
wrong grounds. Those who in making money have
been less successful than others, find it convenient to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
leave all such obligations upon the shoulders of the
richer man, and to say &#8216;it&#8217;s up to him; he can afford
it.&#8217; Is it any wonder that it makes the rich man sour
on subscriptions and philanthropies? He has as
much, or more, of inducement to apply his earnings
and savings to his own ends and pleasures; why then,
is it not up to all, in their own proportions to meet
social needs? A good many years of such meanness
among his neighbors makes even a rich man sour and
mean, I guess. And that&#8217;s what it made me&mdash;and
though that isn&#8217;t a justification of my act, it gave me
as much right to call you skinflints as for you to call
me: all except one of you, Hepsey Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting quivered with tense excitement. What
did it all mean? If a chicken had sneezed the whole
gathering would have been dissolved in hysterics, it
was so keyed up with a sense of the impending disclosure
of a deep mystery. As for Hepsey, she sat
motionless, though Jonathan believed that he caught
sight of a tear glistening in its descent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey Burke had a right to call me a skinflint,
because she knew what none of you knew; but because
it was private knowledge she wouldn&#8217;t make use of it
against me&mdash;not unless she couldn&#8217;t have done what
was right any other way. And now I&#8217;m going to tell
you what she knew:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The rectory was my wife&#8217;s property, and she intended
it as a gift to the parish, for the rectory of
the church. I was preparing the deeds of transfer,
when she died&mdash;suddenly, as some of you remember,&#8221;
his voice made heroic efforts to keep clear and steady,
&#8220;owing to her death before the transfer, that house
passed to our daughter; and what I intended to do
was to buy it of her and present it to the parish. I
delayed, at first for good reasons. And I suppose as
I got more and more lonesome and mixed less and
less with people, I got sourer&mdash;and then I delayed
from meanness. It would have been easy enough for
me to buy it of my daughter, and she&#8217;d have been
willing enough; but as I saw more and more put upon
me, and less and less human recognition&mdash;I was &#8216;a
rich man,&#8217; and needed no personal sympathy or encouragement,
it seemed&mdash;I held back. And I got so
mean, I couldn&#8217;t make friends with the rector,
even.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and from the half smile on his face,
and the hint of brightness that passed over his expression,
the audience caught relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess a good shaking up is good for a man&#8217;s
liver: it cures a sour stomach&mdash;and as there are those
that say the way to a man&#8217;s heart is through his stomach,
perhaps it cures a sour heart. I got my shaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
up all right, as you know; and perhaps that&#8217;s been
working a cure on me. Or perhaps it was the quiet
ministrations of that little Mrs. Betty of yours&#8221;&mdash;applause&mdash;&#8220;or
the infusion of some of the rector&#8217;s
blood in my veins (he let himself be bled to keep me
alive, after I&#8217;d lost what little blood I had, as you
probably have never heard)&#8221;&mdash;shouts of applause&mdash;&#8220;or
possibly what cured me was a little knitting-visit
that Hepsey Burke paid me the other day, and during
which she dropped some home-truths: I can&#8217;t say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I decided what I would do about the rectory,
I wanted to see what you would do, under Mrs.
Burke&#8217;s guidance, this evening. You&#8217;ve shouldered
your share, as far as the rector&#8217;s salary is concerned.
Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll add what I consider my fair share to that,
fifty dollars. The arrears due on the mortgage interest
is one hundred and twenty dollars. I shall hold
you to your side of that bargain, to date. If you pay
the rector the two hundred dollars due him on his
salary, you will need to subscribe about another forty
to make up the interest: that done, and paid to me, I
will do my part, and present the rectory to the parish,
in memory of my dear wife, as she desired.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down.</p>
<p>Hepsey rose and called out in a clear voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right; Mr. Bascom&#8217;s dead right; it&#8217;s up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
us to be business first, and clear ourselves of the debt
on a business bargain; then we can accept the gift
without too much worryin&#8217;.&#8221; And she sent a very
friendly smile over to Bascom.</p>
<p>Again there was some cheering, in the midst of
which Jonathan Jackson jumped to his feet beside
Hepsey; and facing the room, with his arm through
hers, he shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey Burke and me will make up the difference!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another cheer went up, and Hepsey&#8217;s face flamed
scarlet amid the craning of necks and chaffing laughter&mdash;half
puzzled, half understanding.</p>
<p>Sylvester Bascom rose to his feet, and there was
silence. With assumed seriousness he addressed Hepsey,
still standing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burke, so that it may be quite in order, do
you endorse Mr. Jackson&#8217;s authority to speak for you
in this matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Every eye was turned upon them; but Hepsey
could find not a word, so flabergasted was she by this
sudden move of Jonathan&#8217;s. Jonathan himself colored
furiously, but stuck to his guns, and Hepsey&#8217;s
arm:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth,&#8221; he replied in a jaunty
voice, &#8220;Hepsey Burke and me&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be married
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
right now, so I guess we&#8217;ll combine our resources,
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>This announcement gave the coup de grace to any
further attempt at orderliness, and the room became a
seething chorus of congratulatory greetings aimed at
Hepsey and Jonathan, in the midst of which Sylvester
Bascom slipped out unnoticed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>OMNIUM GATHERUM</h3>
</div>
<p>When at last the room emptied, and she was
free to do so, Hepsey, accompanied by the
possessive Jonathan, found her way over to
the Maxwells. Before she started to tell them the
results of the meeting she cast a glance of whimsical
affection at her palpitating fiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d best let him get it off his chest&mdash;then we&#8217;ll
get down to business,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_8' id='linki_8'></a>
<img src='images/illus-309.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 527px; height: 363px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 527px;'>
&#8220;HEPSEY BURKE, FOR ALL YOUR MOLASSES AND THE LITTLE BIT OF VINEGAR YOU SAY YOU KEEP BY YOU, &#8216;THERE ARE NO FLIES ON YOU&#8217; AS NICKEY WOULD PUT IT&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>So Jonathan, amid much handshaking and congratulation
told his victorious story&mdash;until, when he
seemed to Hepsey to become too triumphant, she
broke in with: &#8220;Now that&#8217;s enough for you, Mr.
Proudmouth. Let me just say a word or two, will
you? The meetin&#8217; wasn&#8217;t called for you and me, and
I want to tell about more important happenin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they had heard of all that had been accomplished,
Mrs. Betty got up and put her arms round
Hepsey&#8217;s neck and gave her such a hug, and a kiss on
each cheek, that brought the tears to Mrs. Burke&#8217;s
eyes. And Donald, moist-eyed in spite of himself,
took her hand in both of his, and expressed his feelings
and relieved the tension at the same time by
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepsey Burke, for all your molasses and the little
bit of vinegar you say you keep by you, &#8216;there are no
flies on <i>you</i>&#8217; as Nickey would put it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which sally Jonathan slapped his knee, and ejaculated:</p>
<p>&#8220;No! there &#8217;aint, by gum! There &#8217;aint no flies on
Hepsey, if I <i>do</i> say it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which proprietory speech Hepsey wagged her
head warningly, saying, as they left&mdash;&#8220;There&#8217;s no
downin&#8217; him, these days; I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
come over the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>On their way home Jonathan was urgent for fixing
the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said you&#8217;d marry me right there and then, if
the meetin&#8217; came your way, now you know you did,
Hepsey,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;So if we say to-morrow&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But though Hepsey would never go back on a
promise, she protested against too summary an interpretation
of it, and insisted on due time to prepare
herself for her wedding. So a day was set some two
months hence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sylvester Bascom&#8217;s truer and pristine
nature blossomed forth in the sunnier atmosphere
around him, and after he had delivered himself of
his feelings to the Maxwells, in a visit which he paid
them next day at their nomadic quarters, he begged
leave to put the rectory in full repair before he handed
it over to the parish, and the Maxwells returned
to it.</p>
<p>And he was better than his word; for, with Hepsey
and Virginia accompanying her, he insisted on
Mrs. Betty taking a trip to the city a few days later
for the purpose of selecting furnishings of various
kinds dear to the hearts of housekeepers&mdash;Hepsey
absorbing a share of the time in selecting her &#8220;trousseau.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in due course the rectory was made a
new place, inside and out, and a few weeks after their
return the transformed house, repainted inside and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
out, papered and curtained and charmingly fitted with
new furniture, was again occupied by the Maxwells.</p>
<p>That the interest of the parish should for a while
be concentrated on the doings at the rectory, and diverted
from her own important preparations, was a
blessing to Hepsey&mdash;for she continually declared to
Mrs. Betty that, little as she knew Jonathan in his
new manner, she knew herself less!</p>
<p>It was decided that the wedding should be in the
church, and a reception held after the ceremony, for
the bride and bridegroom, at the rectory&mdash;and that, in
this way, the whole parish would celebrate, in honor
of the auspicious occasion, and of other happy results
of Hepsey&#8217;s parish meeting.</p>
<p>The day before the wedding, while Mrs. Betty and
Virginia were busily occupied at Thunder Cliff and
the rectory, dividing their attentions between the last
touches to Hepsey&#8217;s wardrobe, and preparing confections
for the wedding guests, Donald Maxwell was
closeted with Mr. Bascom at Willow Bluff for a considerable
time. It was known that the Senior Warden
was to support his colleague, Jonathan, at the morrow&#8217;s
event, and it was presumed that the rector was
prompting him in his duties for the occasion.</p>
<p>The ceremony next day at the church was a center
of fervent and cordial good-will and thanksgiving, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
Jonathan, supported by Sylvester Bascom, took to
wife Hepsey, given away by Mrs. Betty, with Virginia
as a kind of maid of honor, hovering near. It
was well for Donald Maxwell that his memory served
him faithfully in conducting the service, for his eyes
were in misty conflict with his bright smile. Nickey
from the front pew, watched his mother with awestruck
eyes, and with son-like amazement at her self-possessed
carriage under the blaze of so much public
attention.</p>
<p>There followed a procession from the church, and
soon the rectory, house and garden, were alive with
chattering groups, of all sorts and conditions, for the
invitations had been general and public, irrespective
of class or sect, at Hepsey&#8217;s special request. There
was a constant line of friends, known and unknown,
filing past bride and bridegroom, with congratulatory
greetings and cordial good wishes. There were
speeches from delegations of various local bodies, and
from local notables of various degrees; and there
were wedding presents, out-vying each other, as it
seemed, in kindly personal significance rather than in
costliness. Among them all, and arranged by Mrs.
Betty at the very center, the Vestry&#8217;s gift to the bride
stood easily first: a plated ice-water pitcher!</p>
<p>It was left to Maxwell to make the farewell speech,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
as the company crowded round the automobile, lent
by the Bascoms, in which Hepsey and Jonathan sat in
smiling happiness, ready to drive to the station, on
their way for a week&#8217;s honeymoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; he said, in a voice that reached to the
skirts of the assembled throng, &#8220;before we give a valedictory
&#8216;three times three&#8217; to the happy couple, I
have to tell you of a plan that has been made to commemorate
this day permanently&mdash;and so that Mrs.
Jackson may not forget the place she holds in our
hearts, and always will hold, as Hepsey Burke.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Mr. Bascom&#8217;s idea, and I know it will give
lasting pleasure to Mrs. Burke&mdash;I mean Mrs. Jackson,&#8221;
he corrected, laughing, &#8220;as well as to all Durford,
young and old. The beautiful piece of woodland,
half a mile beyond Willow Bluff, is to-day presented
by Mr. Bascom to the town, and we shall shortly
repair there to watch the boys erect the tent now
on the church plot, and which Mr. Jackson has kindly
presented to the Boy Scouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; yelled Nickey, in astounded delight, and
leading a cheer that interrupted the speaker for some
moments.</p>
<p>Maxwell continued: &#8220;Mr. Bascom&#8217;s generous gift
to the town will be kept in order by the Boy Scouts,
as their permanent camping-ground&mdash;and I daresay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
Nickey Burke will not be averse to occupying the tent
with his corps, during the week or so that Mrs. Jackson
is to be away. The place is to be called in her
honor&mdash;&#8216;Hepsey Burke Park.&#8217; And now&mdash;Three
cheers for the bride and groom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cheers were given with whole-hearted fervor,
as the man at the wheel tooted, and the auto started
on its way with the smiling pair, followed by the people&#8217;s
delighted shouts of approbation at the happy
plan for perpetuating among them the cheerful name
of Hepsey Burke.</p>
